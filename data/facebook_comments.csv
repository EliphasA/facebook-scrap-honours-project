"Don't lie with HIGR SPEEDY things. Your service is beyond what you say and my dear people The Namibian, do not sign or apply for 36 month contract. You will pay rest of your life whether you are on holiday and don't use your wifi. You can skip two mont… See more"

Then you should stop charging us for those fritzbox
I say again Telecom Namibia Why should we return the item if WE had to pay it off? You dont give fritzboxes for free. If i pay for it its my property.
Now it makes sense than yesterday's vague post of assuming that everyone knows the difference between the two. Anyways a contract is another thievery way of forcing someone to pay for something even when they're no longer interested or get a better op… See more
Telecom Namibia thank you for finally coming to your senses.

Telecom Namibiaa how does the connection process in Swakopmund work? I have been trying to get internet connection for the past two months but I am told they are busy with Matutura and can't take my application as I don't live there?????
I very been with TN for years and am paid up but seem this service is going bad becoming slow a worse I think I should also cancel ....
Ashike reading is a problem mboli

And if I paid it in full and don't want it anymore? Will I be refunded if I bring it back to your office?
Just here for the comments again guys

Why did u charge us for a modem?

How can I return something that I finish paying arleady..
Good day. what to I need to renew my number and how much is it?
Your service is poor Internet down since Thursday and no technicians working weekends
Mxxxxmmmm
Telecom can suck it fr
"They just wanna give heat but they stealing our money. People have been selling their routers, because Telecom Namibia is just trash with their service and client service"
Will Telecom refund us for the devices?
I will break it before I return to you mwakolwa
In other words our housese should turn into a Fritz box museum or how? Who've hurt you Telecom Namibia ?
"Telecom Namibia Please the Nyaope your smoking, stop while the is still time!!"
How will you find out?
"If the router is your property, then do not charge clients for it. #klaar"
I paid for my router!!! How can it still be your property???!!!
Mara can Telecom not focus on improving connectivity services instead of talking about routers that were paid for by the client
"What do you mean by ""owned"" by Telecom Namibia , the devices are usually paid off, within the first couple of installments, according to MY understanding of the agreement, NO?
Plus Telecom Namibia requires/forces the customer to honor that agreement… See more"
Is this device not bought ano..me no understand ? Perhaps we cn get the right to sell but with your office approval to change ownership or renewal of contact.
Telecom Namibia how does my router become your property if I paid for it the day internet was installed I paid for the router in full plus connection fees so I dnt get your story unless if you gave free routers to some customers who might have not paid fr for it
Will you refund what I paid for it upon handing in the device?
"Telecom Namibia I will happily return it back if I get money back first, your services SUCKS"
Make sure you damage beyond repair them before you hand them back.
I gave mine to a strong witchdoctor. You can go get it from him yourselves.
Telecom Namibia I have paid for my Fritzbox. How is it that it is now owned by Telecom Namibia when I have paid for it? Please explain.
The question is are this things still yours I mean we bought them mos
"We we pay for this device, we don't get them for free. So we can dispose in anyway we want."
Sincere and very frank advice!
Why is Telecom Namibia not responding
The comments was nice guys….y’all have covered it properly
Are you going refund us or what will happen? I can't loose it for free just like that.
Umf ndee Telecom mbela you want to bring rules on how to use our money
Too late...
Mine stopped working when I moved from that other dangerous place because the network is swak. It will be in the trash bin soon.
Jaquiline Kurasha I'm here for the comment section
Sorry but we have paid for our router and I have the right to do whatever I want to do should I discontinued with ur service.
Ugh
"But we pay for them which means that, they are our own properties unless you will pay back our money"
Are you going to buy it back?
Is there a refund involved?
"Kako mbuae

What I'd I pay cash for it? Is it still yours or mine?
Ok then I will want to be refunded as we paid for it. Telecom Namibia

"Customers paid for that boxes,will you refund the money paid for that Routers?????"
If we take it back to Telecom will you reimburse us for it then?
As long as you focus on catching the thieves you will not stop this.
Your network is not fine today Ongwediva-Onamutai
We have no adequate businesses and job opportunities in Namibia. Laws enacted over a greed conscience have suppressed us mercilessly.
How do copper cable concern TN? I thought copper cable theft is more for electricity companies or users.
Go after the buyers.
Give the data you promised
Insurance running into the ground. Lol
Namibia Tsu
Telecom please get your service delivery in order before you get ahead of yourself....THE NAMIBIAN PUBLIC have lost all faith in you and you might close your doors very soon! We have other service providers far better than you!
"If you want to stay old and single rest of your life, work for Telecom. No progress, no development, no future..."
What so that they eat from our hard worked money as well . And jump in on the fake promises Telecom Namibia
Ek kani nie die Minister se geleentheid kyk nie want jule flippen internet is alweer vrek af in walvis baai
"Telecom Namibia just fix your network in tsumeb before you tell us about your visitors,"
Tell them to fix their network
"Our datas,since August as promised"
Tunino Haskell
Your network is unreachable every day
Still waiting for the day Telecom Namibia is going to promise us Kapana.
At least Paratus answers their phones.
Will there be a free transport to swakop in case of emergency?
"Our poverty. Telecom Namibia ALWAYS has something interrupting... It isnt. Easy to run. Business huh..,?"
"Failure is your new name, not telecom anymore"
TN you are always apologizing everyday ..
Walvis Bay shop have been offline for renewing Simcards. And I urgently needs mine gor banking purposes
"Telecom is useless mani,when it vome to network, where did you restore network as you communicate"
"Ek is Baie kwaad vir telecom, want ek stuur heel week my werker om my wifi te betaal maar die system is af en nou is my wifi gesny?"
My tn mobile is using recharge first before the data how can i stop it
Just close forever useless
I’m having troubles with the network I don’t have network and I need to make calls … even when I do get a bit of network I can’t make any calls
Hope this will not make TN services expensive
What's wrong with your network
I hope we shall not be experiencing more network shedding from now on.
"The same energy you put in to announce the suspensions of accounts, pls transfer that energy to service delivery as well. Collecting subscriptions only without providing the promised service is actually equal to potential fraud. Telecom Namibia"
Waalye
You've been experiencing connection issues all month now you want to suspend people accounts....DAYLIGHT ROBBERY
"We are used to this threat, if you don't know how to suspend we can suspend them ourselves."
I think we should collectively come together and open a case against telecom namibia for poor service delivery imagine you are paying tens and tens of thousands for their internet services which you use to run critical services like health care etc but… See more
"You make things hard for us because you charge though we're not using your wifi, if I didn't pay that month it means I can't afford that month mara you are still charging mxxxm"

We have been royal to you regardless of the bad network but this is how you want to thank us? Kadhishi dhoshili ndhoka yaya."
You can announce suspension of accounts why not refunding people on subscribed packages that we can't even properly make use of.
SUSPEND THEM WE DONT CARE.. WE CANT BE PAYING FOR SERVICES OF WHICH YOU FAIL TO DELIVER.. Telecom Namibia YOU ARE USELESS!!!
"Waalye, ninga shitoningi maan, jou condense milk"
Payment for a non existing service LOL
Why is telecom Namibia not in the System of Dstv and other service providers where if you don't have money no extra charge but now it's like a cash loan you don't pay it doubles what is that..
There is no value for money and efficient service as you claim.
You are threatening to cut a service that you hardly provide. Doesn't Make sense.
Suspend your accounts we don’t care! We are covered by your competitor MTC!
Telecom Namibia Please Get better IT staff cos is seems like the current staff don't know how to do Thier jobs...
Thats why im no more using yo network. Useless
"Would help if you send out your invoices and we don’t have to ask numerous times
and still don’t get them"
Maybe you must email our bills as you have done for the last 3 years. We are still waiting
Fix your network first man especially in oshakati we can't be paying datas for the whole month and you always have internet issues

That is great. We did not pay deliberately
"Money lovers
service is very poorly"
"They must bring back Frans Ndoroma from retirement please, Zero improvement since he left, they don't even have phones in stock."
The comments
Atleast give us good quality service... so we pay on time with our happy faces!
WHO EVEN GETS PAID ON THAT DATE??
"Please also make me understand how you can suspend unpaid accounts and cut them off on a Sunday but unable to switch them on, Saturday or Sunday, then we have to wait for Monday only...."
Your network is HORRIBLE
When do we get money back for interrupted service from Telecom TN mobile??
"This is what you are good at but when our service is down do we suspend you! You should be ashamed of yourselves. Greedy, incompetent and selfish corporate"
"To provide value for money? You were supposed to be the last entity to say that statement. Your turtle internet is very far from value for money and efficient services, swallow your pride and ask MTC where they get high-speed internet."
"Telecom is a big company but why having poor network ano, they are so ignorant?"
Still waiting for our free datas
Telecom Namibia stop behaving like Swapo
"Call center agent: ""what do we do when they start asking about the free data again?"""
"How many times you guys have to apology? Your service is worrisome, sacks and questionable at same times."
If empty promises was a person... you're just like some people's boyfriend
Is telecom being operated by interns??
Just provide us with service - not empty promises of free data
Last time you promised us free datas...let's know that you changed your mind...
"But I am still unhappy. Telecom Namibia please improve your network, shaashi it might not end well"
Telecom Namibia do you want us to take a peaceful demonstration to demand our free data?
It's a lie.
Me I was not patience. I was angry.
Telecom your service is very worry some because its not up to standard everytime signal is lost i dont no why? Can u plz value your customers.
"Kak, thats bullshit, we are still without data. You let people pay, but give them fokkol service in return, then at least refund your customers for their lost time....have you heard of time is money..."
Just close the company.

Mine never got affected I think I'm TN last born
Swakopmund internet just going on and off. For two months now. Had Paratua do a quote today. You are going Air Namibias road. Good luck.
Telecom Namibia how do you expect people to read your notice if their data is interrupted? At least send smses
"What happened to our data reimbursement on the unlimited packages, till today dololo…. Remember we bought that airtime, it wasn’t free… so keep to your word and give us back what we paid for please!"
What about free datas .. shall we wait for decade ..?
The disease that affect TN will never heal.....it multiply everyday
I can't wait to divorce you!! Sowaar ook.
Telecom Namibiaa small small Jiva airtime countrywide will help ease the inconvenience caused.
How far are you with free data giving
It will be noble for you to post that on a daily basis
We are back online
Please guys work on your network here in the north
Telecom Namibia your apologies are becoming to often daily.
We hear this everyday
There is a document I desperately needed to download while in town. I had to recharge my MTC just to download one document. Then I ask myself is TN really even cheaper?
As always
Every day news now. TNmobile what's wrong with you
We are used to it..
"TN Mobile! Why so many apologies, just apologize with 10GB after the interruption and that is all, as elders we will just understand, thank you in advance"

Try to do something better than pls. We are thirsty here.
Restore your network please

"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to understand why people complain of TN services. Honestly neh, TN is so sharp in Oshakati and Ongwediva, with enough data and fast internet.
Thank you Telecom Namibia"
Telecom Namibia your minutes for Jiva Supreme are very few. Please improve them despite your poor network.

This was the best package.. At first I experienced network problems and I complained and telecom helped to fix. I wish this offer was a permanent one..

Do you perhaps have an online version of the Directory and PLEASE don't tell me to use the 11000 Customer care number cause that is the most useless service that Telecom Namibia is providing..

Clearly this is fake news
Best is now to invest in infrastructure including a better more realisable backup like google equinox then the unreliable one you have going to SA. As an ISP it’s of the utmost that a secondary line equivalent is gotten by telecom.
So telecom doesn’t plan to give the Wi-Fi users prepaid unlimited users any free data at all they claim that it’s only the mobile

I bought a card and tried to get internet settings call 11000 never answer left msg still non the wiser bought jiva and could not even use it. So is it just me or is this poor service cause I no longer have an interest in using this sim if I cannot use internet
"Really Telecom needs to advance its network, it's very slow or it will be out of service for 2 days ne man."

Why is it always Telecom cables being stolen? Maybe you should ask Paratus and MTC how they protect their properties and copy from them. We are tired of this song of yours. Improve the security of your cables if that’s what it means
Did they also steal the cables in Okuryangava since Saturday?
"You are on your best.... No service. Why, just why do you inform us??.we expect it"
"Telecom with ur excuses every month, improve ur services, we gambling in ur company... after paying no network connection...

That is their default excuse. It is annoying to clients whose work depends on your services.

What about Grootfontein? We have no wifi today??
"Why not from 22:00,, from 00:00 we are sleeping already,, so we can wake up early and get ready for work again"
I think you should review the network first. I never pass 400kb/s speed when surfing so I guess you know how slow the downloads are at that speed. Your packages are attractive but your network makes it difficult to support you.
Expire date must be extended to 00:00 please TN and the 200 minutes is too less make it 500
Lemme know if you upgrade the network so I can subscribe for JIVA goed.
"Telecom Namibia the way you treat us with your nertwork is very boring ,your 200minutes are not enough,time for expiring atleast 00.00 not anytime nooo thts not it

The way your network is very poor in walvis keep on wondering if you are serious with service delivery and respecting your customer's or you just completely don't care
You have no customer relationships. Your call centre does not pick up. I suspect you have a hot chocolate fountain that makes your complete call centre want to go to the toilet at once. Know one can answer. Stop the fountain
Telecom Namibia Hopefully this will solve the nonsense of having to put one's phone on flight mode for 5 minutes so that the correct balance reflects after a recharge!
Sluggish network too bad.we are migrating to mtc.
I really hate that we have to rely on your product.
Ur teleshop in katima ran out Sim cards for 2 months I go there's nothing and the price is where to high $30 for a sim.

Your fibre network keeps going on and off.. SO DEFINTELY NOT FIXED... SWAKOPMUND
Why were your clients not informed of the issue since Wednesday? Why does your call centre not anwer the incoming calls? Why do you only inform your clients after the fact and then even up to now internet has not been been restored 5 hours after this p… See more
Services have not been restored.
Definitely not restored on fibre. Services are going on and off the whole time
It's not restored in CBD Windhoek... Speedlink Prepaid Service . Don't lie
"Ya'll should have just left it as it was..now its worse..network cuts off here n there during the day n totally after 12am ..what the he'll mahn,can't even use WhatsApp..what a useless network with such great data rates and packages but USELESS..its a shame"
Are you sure it’s restored?
"Where did you restore?
Still no changes where I am."
I can't believe that the service of Telecom Namibia has not improved one bit in all these year's! It is very frustrating to have to call customer care on 11000 and be kept on hold for 5 to 10 minutes only to be cut of once an agent answers. Pathetic service.
"This happens almost every week, please try to improve, else you must reduce the monthy payment."
Swakopmund still very bad. On and off the whole day. Have phoned technicians and reset the lines. Are you still having problems? Or what is going on? Please we need to work.
We still don't have service in Dorado Park in Windhoek
UR INTERNET IS NONSENSE MAN.MXM PAYING WIFI FOR NOTHING
"Do you guys have like 1 for each day of the week, without dates, so it comes in handy regularly? #AskingForAFriend"
Keep on improving your internet is something else..
How about adding a day or two to the people who bought your “unlimited 30 days” and had no internet for a few days ? Does not seem fair to not compensate these customers
Well southern Namibia is still not “sorted”
What is restored? Internet is weer moer toe
Way way too late
In Kuisebmond WalvisBay it's very slow. Pls improve your service that we are paying for with our hard earned money
"The network is not restored, it is there and 2 seconds later gone, just stop fiddling with it when you have no clue what to do."
Telecom Namibia please improve your internet service in Kuisebmund Walvis Bay very slow.
So that is the reason you didn't want to pick up your calls since Wednesday?
You are the best of best in data
Services has NOT been restoted INTERNET is not working
Thanks guys..
"Your service ist still not working normally in Swakopmund!
After 14h00 it’s almost dead.

Do you restored it at usakos its too slow
If you guys you don't want us to use your network tells Us so we can not waste time and mostly our money thanks you
"Since 13:00 my internet connection is gone it’s saying DSL connection interrupted, what can I do guys?"
The problem has not been resolved! It still persists in the Rocky Crest - Khomasdal area.
Ondangwa no change at all
Ain’t no way coz I bought the unlimited data pack for 7 days but I’m not enjoying any of it because I can’t stream movies or even game stream . So if I buy for 1k+ the data will be bad too ? Swakopmund
Your Khorixas technical team is useless
"We are here at imparila Island

Nice deals but just boost your network signal then you'll have all Namibians flocking to TN Mobile. Your 4G feels like 3G or 3G. Awful at times.

"Chala Swakop TattooGuru Good day,"

Your service is ridiculously bad. I have asked for an upgrade last year end November, I have Fiber cables hanging out of my wall, but no technician. So what to do?"
The side of Kasika and impalila in Katima mulilo the is no network since last week for 5 to 6days now can Telecom please look into it.

You never answered your phone call
Don't re-open it. Just keep it closed. Closed like your network when you need it.
Yours service is deteriorating these days. Your shop in Ongwediva does not have simcards for replacement.
Thanks for the update.
"Telecom Namibia I register my Jiva on the 19 of this month, you guys took everything my minutes, credit, sms and datas. I've been calling and you people promise to bring back my Jiva and to extend it. But still now nothing happen. You guys do something"
"Your tn mobile network and your WiFi technicians are not making sure
Telecom Namibia"
It sucks
Just liquidate the whole company and declare bankruptcy Jule is useless.
"I will never forget the day my supreme expired with 9G literally after seven days, you hardly use your data the entire internet service is just kak."
Those numbers are forever offline... There is no time you find it online....
"TN Mobile Customer Care Agents is lovely, friendly, helpful and profesionals. Its only the service network that is NON-EXISTING at the coast!!!! Not the money worth!!!"
"Telecom Namibia
Please restore your network in Ohangwena region we have been left out this whole week, it's really a disappointment"

No your network is not proper as usual....
Upgrade your network please it is very weak
So is the network
Renatha Adriaanse
Ever thought about upgrading the network capacity to your towers in Swakop. ? It doesn't help selling bandwidth you don't have.
"It's true your Datas are affordable to say, However the network coverage. I have Datas but very poor internet."

Extend it please March is close !
"Make it permanent TN. We have been enjoying it when it was $185 and now even on a cheaper prize, we continue using it"
"Katima Mulilo Teleshop has not been having TD-LTE devices for years now. We can't be going for only Wimax by force, please"
I have been calling 11000 all day and no one is answering!
Call centre is not answering and also not calling back
"Pathetic service delivery, poor network coverage, lack of innovative products and constant problems with network is what is keeping TN mobile behind in Namibia"
"Your centre never answers nor do they call back. I pay for my subscriptions weekly. 3 days ago I registered Jiva Supreme and today? It's all gone while the 3days proved to be slow internet it doesn't even show how many calls, Sms or data I have left an… See more"
Call centre is still not answering or calling back!!

We're used now.
Can you please give a update on when problem can be resolved. Your customer care is not even picking up their phones.
"Kak... If our pocket Wi-fi are not working, how do you expect us to see this? SMS next time.
Check if those who work at Call Center are alive.. the call is ringing until one cut it off.."
At the coast TN Mobile is a frustration for months now!! Guys you have to fix this FAST!! We buy alot of airtime that means nothing to us.
Telecom Namibia are you sure telecommunication is your speciality I think you are forcing things maybe you are are farmers or a Volleyball team sowaar.
I did subscribe to Jiva Supreme yesterday and I did not even use my datas and can't even call
Just give up
TN improve your service please we are your customers treat us with dignity...your service down and it’s the customers to call and ask not you texting to inform us .now some of us our jiva is expired without using it as we should and you are eating data alot
Im not able to send sms nor make calls from 085 in Windhoek. And what the hell is wrong with your customer care center????
"Even my Celphone in Windhoek I can’t make calls or send sms is just failing and your 11000 is never answered, you have bad infrastructure that are so susceptible to any small drop of rain"
No wonder this company is in top 5 worse companies in Namibia.
Your network in Okahao is almost dead also. Not able to load a webpage or send a mail eith TN mobiles internet. Calls also nog going through
"TN Mobile, the same problems seem to persis on the mobile devices as well and not just landlines."
"I'm experiencing problem with calls,is there any problem"
"Your network sucks in walvis Bay, imagine went to activate my java plus, but I couldn't access to Internet while I was still in your shop, with your tower on top."
"Telecom employees especially those tasked with handling the network, pull your socks up before you guys follow in the footsteps of Air Namibia. It will be a pity not just for the employees but also us as your customers. You cannot ignore the bad review… See more"
Is there a number that actually works to call your contact center?? It's so frustrating to dial numbers you put on posters and ads but they don't go through or no one picks up? Telecom Namibia

Your network is worrisome.. Verybad since December holiday.
"Best network in Namibia, fastest internet on the cheapest prices. Y'all are the aces"

#Telecom fix your useless network!
I'm one of those clients that make sure my account is paid on time..... please tell me that I'm not going pay anything this month as your network is not working at all.
Is better for account to be suspended than paying for a poor service.
It's January bro. Leave us alone at least for now. Please man
Clients should also suspend payments on services not delivered.
Unpaid accounts due to poor service. Me personally I don't feel pain for my account suspend.
We keep paying for bad network service that is constantly being bad first fix your internet issues service before applying suspension on people’s account
"Let him suspend his bad network and let's all terminate our contracts. simple as that. Costly, yes but worth it."
"It will not help to cut off your clients that dont pay.They pay for limited on off wifi anyways
.So you must start to brain storm why they dont want to pay."
Sies!!! En dan moet ons wag as daar interruptions is by ons wifi... want julle vat moes jul tyd...GMF
Not Telecom Namibia ignoring its customers.
I dnt understand why they don't switch on the wifi immediately when payment is done now you have to wait 2 - 3 days nonsense..And poor service on top of everything else
Telecom is a big scammer.y do one have to pay if he/she not using it? Y can’t they do like DStv.their network is even poor
"Why can't you wait for month end, when your clients got something? You know it was a holiday and your client have used their December salary to buy stationeries, pay school fees and now their pockets is dry."
"Your service is pathetic, zero customer service, Telecom your interest is only money improve your services first than cash will overflow, we want value for our money."

You're lying
Julle is so vinnig om te suspend.
We have not had Internet connection since December can you get your services up and running first
"Sny maar af....wie traak hoeka.

"As if you offer better service, mxiiiiiiiiium."
We need a 24/7 helpline for you WiFi services and some of us no longer receive you bill letters. Your services can be down for months yet we still pay
"Since when are the unpaid accounts active, or are you selective when it comes to suspending accounts??"
Poor service year in and out....shuu you have the audacity to threaten customers
Noted uncle Telecom Namibia for your kindness
To suspend if you cant deliver servise. Tn mobile is just as useless best deals. But poor coverage and today cant make calls. If seriveses is off why must-we still pay mtc have coverage over namibia tn nothing in arias far off
My network is very poor since I refused to move to a bigger package. Fix it please
"If the datas are not working the calls are not going through for the whole week your service is pathetic stressing us everyday ask MTC how they are doing it pls ,you don't take your clients complain serious who's your CEO even"

Even ur staff they have TN simcards an they know all the struggles"
Why does the jiva have to end exactly the time you registered it why not just in the midnight
"Bad internet connection (slow,) somedays not working offline"
Your network doesn't worth our money honestly.
"Dear Telecom Namibia, I move from Windhoek to Keetmanshoop (Kronlien) and now I stay in Noordhoek Keetmanshoop. Your service is worse, I pay money for nothing.pleas improve."

"Even if you send your complaints, telecom will do nothing about it. Closed my account because of this."
"Your internet connection is very poor please

"Your network connection not countywide , just imagine you are in Windhoek like in Goreagab and you can not access to network so poor... Coming to rural areas like in the constituency of Onesi , specific at Omahenene and surrounding areas there no connection at all"
It takes more than 20 minutes for my calls to be attended to
My datas use to expire without being used due to poor network here in tura. Pls work on your network coverage its so stressful
"Télé on, why do t you invest in your 4G equipment at the coast, you are selling us products with no output."
"Why is 11000 not working today? Telecom knows it has poor service and therefore a high call log of complaints is expected, but now the number is ""... not able to take your call right now, pls try again later.""

Etetewe ombili pls service has been off for two weeks now… I’m so done with Telecom
"But ever since your network never worked in areas of ohangwena region... even areas surrounding Helao nafidi town council... to be specific, areas like omatunda, eembo, onekwaya, okadila okatope onengali odibo, just mention a few"

Poor service
Kleine kuppe Windhoek area as well. No internet connection but the monthly payment is deducted on time. Never a problem there with deductions from the accounts by Telecom Namibia but they can never fix the issue on time
"My house and office lines are dead in Cimbebasia as well. I phoned all the Windhoek teleshops, no one is answering. This is not customer driven service"
Wanaheda has not been having connection issues for over a week now.. Julle speel lekker met ons neh!!
"With or without service interruption, your network and internet reception is 100% poor be it within town or the outskirts.. thinking of terminating my WiFi contract and try MTC instead... shaaahi this is becoming too much"

Your network is extremely terrible. Why should I even bother subscribing to your packages if I can't even use them due to poor poor network.
"Their service is up to nothing, USELESS EVER!!"
"TN YOU MUST TREND ONE WAY AROUND YOUR NETWORK PLEASE... VERY VERY POOR ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL AREAS LIKE EUNDA AND SURROUNDING , IMAGINE WE ON HOLIDAY AND NO ACCESS TO NETWORK AND WE HAVE 31 DAYS DATAS TO USE.... ITS A HEAL"
Paying for poor internet reception.. Its very frustrating but TN is here demanding for payment.. nonsense man..
"Your network is very poor the whole day in Oshakati, while subscription 31 days are going, it's only night time it's better, it's unfair."

Totally becoming a problem once again same problem is this a weekly thing.
All I ask as a loyal customer that subscribes yo jiva Supreme every week consecutively is that you reward me with a jiva Supreme because this is unacceptable. Thank you
