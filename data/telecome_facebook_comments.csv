Nope ...I'd rather get jiva its like unlimited but atleast its 7days for less...poor marketing skills
"Improve your internet nee please.

Very frustrating don't you get tired.
Telecom Namibia What about the #FreeData you promised long ago ? The year is about to END and you haven't given us anything
Now we are paying for no connection. This is so unfair
Your network failure prevented me from winning my millions
So sad that it's only our Network that are sabotage .

Ano who is the CEO of this company?
That is a useless important information. Who need to register?
"Just give up. Useless network

"I have been visiting Wbay shop to renew and if it is not cards that are not available, it's offline. Even the guard knows me by now. It's tiring not having things in place to assist customers."
I vist telecom Namibia last year to register and they ask my document now i confirm if my number register and they say no..I dnor why they took my document and for what reason if i went there to register now the number is not register?
What about people that are not currently in Namibia? How can we register our number?

How do someone enjoy the communication services if the network is not working. Every 2de day network issues.
Horrible service
What I need to bring when I come to register my car

Telecom needs a turnaround strategy with more capable hands and not sellout
Hapo why does this cable theft only happen to Telecom infrastructure? I have never heard of MTC or Paratus customers complain about this.
TN just tell us that if this affects the whole country because since Friday night up to now your system is off and why this syndicate of cable theft always only happen to Telecom infrastructure?
Even in Eenhana since Tuesday we are unable to send SMSes. Fix that too.
Even in Swakopmund.
The internet’s is so bad here at the coast like seriously this limitless internet really feels limited
And at the coast? Telekom users struggle with internet in Swakop and Henties

your network os not functioning
Ano did you hire trainees ?
we're used now
Just throw the whole company away.
Because they have imcompetant employees. I am going to start paying my account pro rata. Subtract the hours that my internet does not function properly

Ashike reading is a problem mboli
Telecom Namibia thank you for finally coming to your senses.
Just here for the comments again guys
Telecom Namibiaa how does the connection process in Swakopmund work? I have been trying to get internet connection for the past two months but I am told they are busy with Matutura and can't take my application as I don't live there?????
"NOW, you're talking Telecom Namibia ."
Now it's clear not as yesterday.

Telecom Namibia please arrange to cone and remove your equipment.

Good day. what to I need to renew my number and how much is it?
Why did u charge us for a modem?
"Funny, if Fritxbox becomes faulty or damaged by lightning, you have to buy a new one. Thus proving that you dont want to take responsibility for the customers equipment????Thus belongs to customer."
Its cause of shaninugans like this yall are loosing clients to paratus
"Secondly a client is more then allowed to sell their devices, as we have bought the devices. The contract is a different argument but selling their routers cause they no longer have their contracts so Telecom Namibia gettting mad because people are sel… See more"
Weak network
Mxxxxmmmm
And if I paid it in full and don't want it anymore? Will I be refunded if I bring it back to your office?
How can I return something that I finish paying arleady..
Telecom can suck it fr
"Telecom NamibiaTelecom Namibia ,please work on improving your network, and we are waiting for the free data don't come distract us with CPE things you still owe us."
"They just wanna give heat but they stealing our money. People have been selling their routers, because Telecom Namibia is just trash with their service and client service"
Fudapo utale Telecom Namibia
Will Telecom refund us for the devices?
I will break it before I return to you mwakolwa
Mara can Telecom not focus on improving connectivity services instead of talking about routers that were paid for by the client
I paid for my router!!! How can it still be your property???!!!
"What do you mean by ""owned"" by Telecom Namibia , the devices are usually paid off, within the first couple of installments, according to MY understanding of the agreement, NO?
Plus Telecom Namibia requires/forces the customer to honor that agreement… See more"
In other words our housese should turn into a Fritz box museum or how? Who've hurt you Telecom Namibia ?
How will you find out?
Telecom Namibia how does my router become your property if I paid for it the day internet was installed I paid for the router in full plus connection fees so I dnt get your story unless if you gave free routers to some customers who might have not paid fr for it
"If the router is your property, then do not charge clients for it. #klaar"
"Telecom Namibia Please the Nyaope your smoking, stop while the is still time!!"
Will you refund what I paid for it upon handing in the device?
The comments was nice guys….y’all have covered it properly
Is this device not bought ano..me no understand ? Perhaps we cn get the right to sell but with your office approval to change ownership or renewal of contact.
Make sure you damage beyond repair them before you hand them back.
Sorry but we have paid for our router and I have the right to do whatever I want to do should I discontinued with ur service.
Sincere and very frank advice!
The question is are this things still yours I mean we bought them mos
Mine stopped working when I moved from that other dangerous place because the network is swak. It will be in the trash bin soon.
"We we pay for this device, we don't get them for free. So we can dispose in anyway we want."
I gave mine to a strong witchdoctor. You can go get it from him yourselves.
Are you going refund us or what will happen? I can't loose it for free just like that.
Are you going to buy it back?
Too late...
Than you refund our money
Ugh
"But we pay for them which means that, they are our own properties unless you will pay back our money"
Telecom Namibia I have paid for my Fritzbox. How is it that it is now owned by Telecom Namibia when I have paid for it? Please explain.
What I'd I pay cash for it? Is it still yours or mine?
Is there a refund involved?
Monopoly
How much you will pay to return

What if I thrown it in the dam or well? I think it's a good idea
You're crazy
I paid 1700 for mine will I be refunded??and just how is it still your property?
"Customers paid for that boxes,will you refund the money paid for that Routers?????"
If we take it back to Telecom will you reimburse us for it then?
As long as you focus on catching the thieves you will not stop this.
Insurance running into the ground. Lol
We have no adequate businesses and job opportunities in Namibia. Laws enacted over a greed conscience have suppressed us mercilessly.
Your network is not fine today Ongwediva-Onamutai
Go after the buyers.
How do copper cable concern TN? I thought copper cable theft is more for electricity companies or users.
Give the data you promised
Namibia Tsu
Telecom please get your service delivery in order before you get ahead of yourself....THE NAMIBIAN PUBLIC have lost all faith in you and you might close your doors very soon! We have other service providers far better than you!
"If you want to stay old and single rest of your life, work for Telecom. No progress, no development, no future..."
"Our datas,since August as promised"
What so that they eat from our hard worked money as well . And jump in on the fake promises Telecom Namibia
"Telecom Namibia just fix your network in tsumeb before you tell us about your visitors,"
Tell them to fix their network
Ek kani nie die Minister se geleentheid kyk nie want jule flippen internet is alweer vrek af in walvis baai
Your network is unreachable every day
Tunino Haskell
At least Paratus answers their phones.
"Page of disappointment, can Telecom Namibia just stop posting stuff… No good news had ever came from these page…. Reimburse our Data Unlimited packages as promised!"
TN you are always apologizing everyday ..
Still waiting for the day Telecom Namibia is going to promise us Kapana.
Will there be a free transport to swakop in case of emergency?
My tn mobile is using recharge first before the data how can i stop it
"Failure is your new name, not telecom anymore"
"Ek is Baie kwaad vir telecom, want ek stuur heel week my werker om my wifi te betaal maar die system is af en nou is my wifi gesny?"
Walvis Bay shop have been offline for renewing Simcards. And I urgently needs mine gor banking purposes
"Our poverty. Telecom Namibia ALWAYS has something interrupting... It isnt. Easy to run. Business huh..,?"
"Telecom is useless mani,when it vome to network, where did you restore network as you communicate"
Just close forever useless
I’m having troubles with the network I don’t have network and I need to make calls … even when I do get a bit of network I can’t make any calls
Hope this will not make TN services expensive
I hope we shall not be experiencing more network shedding from now on.
What's wrong with your network
Waalye
"We are used to this threat, if you don't know how to suspend we can suspend them ourselves."
"The same energy you put in to announce the suspensions of accounts, pls transfer that energy to service delivery as well. Collecting subscriptions only without providing the promised service is actually equal to potential fraud. Telecom Namibia"
You've been experiencing connection issues all month now you want to suspend people accounts....DAYLIGHT ROBBERY
I think we should collectively come together and open a case against telecom namibia for poor service delivery imagine you are paying tens and tens of thousands for their internet services which you use to run critical services like health care etc but… See more
"You make things hard for us because you charge though we're not using your wifi, if I didn't pay that month it means I can't afford that month mara you are still charging mxxxm"
You can announce suspension of accounts why not refunding people on subscribed packages that we can't even properly make use of.
"Epuko nale olo you are trying to do Telecom Namibia.
We have been royal to you regardless of the bad network but this is how you want to thank us? Kadhishi dhoshili ndhoka yaya."
Payment for a non existing service LOL
SUSPEND THEM WE DONT CARE.. WE CANT BE PAYING FOR SERVICES OF WHICH YOU FAIL TO DELIVER.. Telecom Namibia YOU ARE USELESS!!!
You only know how to suspend accounts on time while your wifi services is so slow. Please improve your services
"Waalye, ninga shitoningi maan, jou condense milk"
That is great. We did not pay deliberately
You are threatening to cut a service that you hardly provide. Doesn't Make sense.
Why is telecom Namibia not in the System of Dstv and other service providers where if you don't have money no extra charge but now it's like a cash loan you don't pay it doubles what is that..
Maybe you must email our bills as you have done for the last 3 years. We are still waiting
This bull shot but can’t give our free data and Wi-Fi
There is no value for money and efficient service as you claim.
"Would help if you send out your invoices and we don’t have to ask numerous times
and still don’t get them"
Fix your network first man especially in oshakati we can't be paying datas for the whole month and you always have internet issues
Suspend your accounts we don’t care! We are covered by your competitor MTC!
"Very good, they can not jam the network while they did not pay their accounts"
Telecom Namibia Please Get better IT staff cos is seems like the current staff don't know how to do Thier jobs...
"Try Paratus my people..., top top service there..."
Did you give the free data you promised
The comments
"Please also make me understand how you can suspend unpaid accounts and cut them off on a Sunday but unable to switch them on, Saturday or Sunday, then we have to wait for Monday only...."
"They must bring back Frans Ndoroma from retirement please, Zero improvement since he left, they don't even have phones in stock."
Telecom Namibia everytime suspending suspending ooh your network is poor
Atleast give us good quality service... so we pay on time with our happy faces!
"Nonsense
I will not pay
… See more"
Thats why im no more using yo network. Useless
When do we get money back for interrupted service from Telecom TN mobile??
"Quick to suspend unpaid accounts, but fail to sort out your forever technical issues....."
WHO EVEN GETS PAID ON THAT DATE??
Your network is HORRIBLE
"Money lovers
service is very poorly"
"Telecom Namibia hope you’re reading the comments almost everyone is worried about your service, your network is so poor."
"This is what you are good at but when our service is down do we suspend you! You should be ashamed of yourselves. Greedy, incompetent and selfish corporate"
"To provide value for money? You were supposed to be the last entity to say that statement. Your turtle internet is very far from value for money and efficient services, swallow your pride and ask MTC where they get high-speed internet."
"Telecom is a big company but why having poor network ano, they are so ignorant?"
Still waiting for our free datas
Telecom Namibia stop behaving like Swapo
"Call center agent: ""what do we do when they start asking about the free data again?"""
"How many times you guys have to apology? Your service is worrisome, sacks and questionable at same times."
Is telecom being operated by interns??
Last time you promised us free datas...let's know that you changed your mind...
Just provide us with service - not empty promises of free data
If empty promises was a person... you're just like some people's boyfriend
It's a lie.
Me I was not patience. I was angry.
Your Service is worrisome
Telecom Namibia do you want us to take a peaceful demonstration to demand our free data?
"But I am still unhappy. Telecom Namibia please improve your network, shaashi it might not end well"
"Kak, thats bullshit, we are still without data. You let people pay, but give them fokkol service in return, then at least refund your customers for their lost time....have you heard of time is money..."
We used to the pain
What about our free data bundles? Yee shili nyeee

And our free data and Wi-Fi
Mine never got affected I think I'm TN last born
Swakopmund internet just going on and off. For two months now. Had Paratua do a quote today. You are going Air Namibias road. Good luck.
What about free datas .. shall we wait for decade ..?
Telecom Namibia how do you expect people to read your notice if their data is interrupted? At least send smses
"What happened to our data reimbursement on the unlimited packages, till today dololo…. Remember we bought that airtime, it wasn’t free… so keep to your word and give us back what we paid for please!"
I can't wait to divorce you!! Sowaar ook.
Telecom Namibiaa small small Jiva airtime countrywide will help ease the inconvenience caused.
We hear this everyday
There is a document I desperately needed to download while in town. I had to recharge my MTC just to download one document. Then I ask myself is TN really even cheaper?
The disease that affect TN will never heal.....it multiply everyday

Best is now to invest in infrastructure including a better more realisable backup like google equinox then the unreliable one you have going to SA. As an ISP it’s of the utmost that a secondary line equivalent is gotten by telecom.
So telecom doesn’t plan to give the Wi-Fi users prepaid unlimited users any free data at all they claim that it’s only the mobile

"Poor service, I better spent more on MTC rather than spent less on poor quality products of Telecom Namibia"
Uselessness is becoming their logo everywhere
"This tn mobile is a scam, you subscribe to a jiva supreme, after that the network excuse and we are left dry. No remedy to that. Yet you are promoting. Is this witchcraft?"
Why don't you improve your network ?
telecom needs to be sued for constantly taking money for a service it has no capacity to provide.
I don't understand this $30 bucks just for 3 days while there are subscriptions for 7 days!?. Someone explain please.
Telecom Namibia fix ur Network it's wasting money buying data's I can't use

"Telecom cannot control if a shark comes and munches on a cable. Internet will be back when repairs are done in due time. For now, go outside and touch some grass."
"Telecom please 3 months your service is just poor, refund our money."

"Stop using old system of cables, move to satellite connection"
"Soek re divers wat kan gaan,of vra Sean naidoo laat hy julle help"
Excuse after another... A week can not go by without internet connection interruptions
When will this be fixed???? It's been weeks!!!!
Telecom Namibia everyday you have a problem
First you said you need money. Now it's fibre break. Now which one should we help?
Is this issue still not resolved. We are experiencing total black out of TN network from morning 08H00 to 19H30 at night. What is going on? Will we be reimbursed with more data bundles?
Paratus se internet werk dan reg? Gebruik hulle nie ook WACS?

Van Wyke
I bought a card and tried to get internet settings call 11000 never answer left msg still non the wiser bought jiva and could not even use it. So is it just me or is this poor service cause I no longer have an interest in using this sim if I cannot use internet
"Og, please Telecom Namibia not all of us we can afford to get the proof of residence please"
"What's this proof of residence for when it's simply registering a sim card? And for someone who lives in a rural village, what proof of residence must he/she bring?"

But improve your network is to slow
Why is it always Telecom cables being stolen? Maybe you should ask Paratus and MTC how they protect their properties and copy from them. We are tired of this song of yours. Improve the security of your cables if that’s what it means
That is their default excuse. It is annoying to clients whose work depends on your services.
"You are on your best.... No service. Why, just why do you inform us??.we expect it"
Last night from 12 midnight your fiber Wi-Fi went until 2 midnight in Khomasdal 16 .The way we pay full amount you should learn to compensate
"Telecom with ur excuses every month, improve ur services, we gambling in ur company... after paying no network connection...

How long will this take

I can supply you with lockable manhole covers. How many do you need.
Your network delays us
Are you now going to replace our day for not using data or what now?
Poor service ever
The side of Otjomiuse your network's always slow or at times unavailable at all
It's also not working in Gobabis
These maggots need a tough competitor

In Walvis bay network is killing us...1000 SMS where suppose to be Minutes"
I think you should review the network first. I never pass 400kb/s speed when surfing so I guess you know how slow the downloads are at that speed. Your packages are attractive but your network makes it difficult to support you.
Expire date must be extended to 00:00 please TN and the 200 minutes is too less make it 500

The way your network is very poor in walvis keep on wondering if you are serious with service delivery and respecting your customer's or you just completely don't care
I really hate that we have to rely on your product.
You have no customer relationships. Your call centre does not pick up. I suspect you have a hot chocolate fountain that makes your complete call centre want to go to the toilet at once. Know one can answer. Stop the fountain
Sluggish network too bad.we are migrating to mtc.
Telecom Namibia Hopefully this will solve the nonsense of having to put one's phone on flight mode for 5 minutes so that the correct balance reflects after a recharge!

Your fibre network keeps going on and off.. SO DEFINTELY NOT FIXED... SWAKOPMUND
Services have not been restored.
"Ya'll should have just left it as it was..now its worse..network cuts off here n there during the day n totally after 12am ..what the he'll mahn,can't even use WhatsApp..what a useless network with such great data rates and packages but USELESS..its a shame"
Are you sure it’s restored?
"Where did you restore?
Still no changes where I am."
Swakopmund still very bad. On and off the whole day. Have phoned technicians and reset the lines. Are you still having problems? Or what is going on? Please we need to work.
"Do you guys have like 1 for each day of the week, without dates, so it comes in handy regularly? #AskingForAFriend"
"This happens almost every week, please try to improve, else you must reduce the monthy payment."
We still don't have service in Dorado Park in Windhoek
It's not restored in CBD Windhoek... Speedlink Prepaid Service . Don't lie
Definitely not restored on fibre. Services are going on and off the whole time
UR INTERNET IS NONSENSE MAN.MXM PAYING WIFI FOR NOTHING
In Kuisebmond WalvisBay it's very slow. Pls improve your service that we are paying for with our hard earned money
Telecom Namibia please improve your internet service in Kuisebmund Walvis Bay very slow.
Keep on improving your internet is something else..
How about adding a day or two to the people who bought your “unlimited 30 days” and had no internet for a few days ? Does not seem fair to not compensate these customers
I can't believe that the service of Telecom Namibia has not improved one bit in all these year's! It is very frustrating to have to call customer care on 11000 and be kept on hold for 5 to 10 minutes only to be cut of once an agent answers. Pathetic service.
So that is the reason you didn't want to pick up your calls since Wednesday?
"Your service ist still not working normally in Swakopmund!
After 14h00 it’s almost dead.
Before that it’s on off the whole time.… See more"
Your service was again down for an hour! This is not acceptable at all!

The problem has not been resolved! It still persists in the Rocky Crest - Khomasdal area.
Telecom Namibia how do I become a promoter of your company?
"Since 13:00 my internet connection is gone it’s saying DSL connection interrupted, what can I do guys?"
Ondangwa no change at all
If you guys you don't want us to use your network tells Us so we can not waste time and mostly our money thanks you
Hi im still struggling with slow Internet. Called 11000 apparently no issues reported for khomasdal. The number 11444 not answering. Getting frustrated now
Ain’t no way coz I bought the unlimited data pack for 7 days but I’m not enjoying any of it because I can’t stream movies or even game stream . So if I buy for 1k+ the data will be bad too ? Swakopmund

Telecom Namibia.
Why has your internet been either very slow or off every single night from 7:30 until around 21:00 for the past week?? I payed for unlimited data but now money is wasted because there is no internet....
"Ag you are never reachable,there ain't no difference here"
I just subscribed to jiva supreme but I only received 5GB???
are you still busy with the routine maintenence...I bought unlimited data for 6 months and it's off more than its on! please this is not acceptable.
TN is very shitty.. they just cut off the system last week for like 3 days and now again they're telling us this.. seems like our money is just for mahala mbela.. they should tell us to stop recharging utale..
When does your contact centre EVER WORK?????
TN network is very slow am wasting my moneybag

I applied for WiFi almost a year ago still no feedback
"Chala Swakop TattooGuru Good day,"
"Please help us this side of katimamulilo, Impalila,there’s no network for 5 consecutive days please,you are ever saying you will solve it but nothing"
Coastal internet is a total nightmare!!!

Windhoek as well!
Everyday with excuses.
Walvis as well. Thus is too much
Eeewa ... Telecom odikulike unene... thanks
You never answered your phone call
"Telecom Namibia Telecom Namibia than bring back my credit, minute, datas and sms."
Don't re-open it. Just keep it closed. Closed like your network when you need it.
"Telecom Namibia I register my Jiva on the 19 of this month, you guys took everything my minutes, credit, sms and datas. I've been calling and you people promise to bring back my Jiva and to extend it. But still now nothing happen. You guys do something"
Thanks for the update.
"Your tn mobile network and your WiFi technicians are not making sure
Telecom Namibia"
Yours service is deteriorating these days. Your shop in Ongwediva does not have simcards for replacement.
It sucks
Just liquidate the whole company and declare bankruptcy Jule is useless.
"I will never forget the day my supreme expired with 9G literally after seven days, you hardly use your data the entire internet service is just kak."
Those numbers are forever offline... There is no time you find it online....
Telecom honestly you're nothing but a disappointment uh
"Telecom Namibia
Please restore your network in Ohangwena region we have been left out this whole week, it's really a disappointment"
Even your network is offline
Theree by your number they aint responding ela...

Yah TN
Does Telecom and Nored have the same boss? Because both are ............
We don’t care it never went through
"Aiye, it was off since last year."
Upgrade your network please it is very weak
So is the network
"TN Mobile Customer Care Agents is lovely, friendly, helpful and profesionals. Its only the service network that is NON-EXISTING at the coast!!!! Not the money worth!!!"
No your network is not proper as usual....
Ever thought about upgrading the network capacity to your towers in Swakop. ? It doesn't help selling bandwidth you don't have.
"Don't end it plz, just make it permanent"
Renatha Adriaanse
"It's true your Datas are affordable to say, However the network coverage. I have Datas but very poor internet."
But your minutes mostly are depleted just after 20 minutes of talking or less
TN Mobile is probably the worst mobile network in Namibia. I live close to the cellphone tower and have horrible network. Even in town it's a problem.
"Katima Mulilo Teleshop has not been having TD-LTE devices for years now. We can't be going for only Wimax by force, please"
I have been calling 11000 all day and no one is answering!
Call centre is not answering and also not calling back
"Pathetic service delivery, poor network coverage, lack of innovative products and constant problems with network is what is keeping TN mobile behind in Namibia"
Call centre is still not answering or calling back!!
Pls can you tell us what is going on? Cant recharge
Its off again in Okahao
Pathetic service ever.I am facing another weekend without wifi that i fully paid for.
Why don't you just close down? Julle bly fokken offline of dit en dat werk nie...
We're used now.
"Kak... If our pocket Wi-fi are not working, how do you expect us to see this? SMS next time.
Check if those who work at Call Center are alive.. the call is ringing until one cut it off.."
Can you please give a update on when problem can be resolved. Your customer care is not even picking up their phones.
I did subscribe to Jiva Supreme yesterday and I did not even use my datas and can't even call
Telecom Namibia are you sure telecommunication is your speciality I think you are forcing things maybe you are are farmers or a Volleyball team sowaar.
At the coast TN Mobile is a frustration for months now!! Guys you have to fix this FAST!! We buy alot of airtime that means nothing to us.
Just give up
TN improve your service please we are your customers treat us with dignity...your service down and it’s the customers to call and ask not you texting to inform us .now some of us our jiva is expired without using it as we should and you are eating data alot
Im not able to send sms nor make calls from 085 in Windhoek. And what the hell is wrong with your customer care center????
"TN Mobile, the same problems seem to persis on the mobile devices as well and not just landlines."
"Even my Celphone in Windhoek I can’t make calls or send sms is just failing and your 11000 is never answered, you have bad infrastructure that are so susceptible to any small drop of rain"
No wonder this company is in top 5 worse companies in Namibia.
"I tried making calls and it's Nonsense, improve"
"Thanks you for respecting Time, we hope other’s follow in your footsteps."
Where is our free data Telecom Namibia
Then you must pay us who went through the trouble of police declaration and all that

"Improve your internet nee please.

Proof of residence for what on simcard registration you are just making things difficult same way you make it difficult for us to use your data's
#Telecom Namibia you must learn how to attend to questions. Your salary and profit comes from us.
Laod 20 GB data on all registered sim card Telecom Namibia . And you still owe us free data that you promised us sometimes back
your network os not functioning
Ano did you hire trainees ?
we're used now
Just throw the whole company away.
Because they have imcompetant employees. I am going to start paying my account pro rata. Subtract the hours that my internet does not function properly
You better introduce an unlimited internet 4G Sim card for for at least R317 per month sis. Learn something from the South African internet is cheap here
Does it ever work? See these notices so regularly.

I say again Telecom Namibia Why should we return the item if WE had to pay it off? You dont give fritzboxes for free. If i pay for it its my property.
This is not the way forward. Who agreed to posting the and everyone involved should sign a warning. You are just hurting the brand
Now you are talking.. us who bought it those fritz box cash belongs to us..thank you for clarification..

Will Telecom refund us for the devices?
I will break it before I return to you mwakolwa
Mara can Telecom not focus on improving connectivity services instead of talking about routers that were paid for by the client
I paid for my router!!! How can it still be your property???!!!
"What do you mean by ""owned"" by Telecom Namibia , the devices are usually paid off, within the first couple of installments, according to MY understanding of the agreement, NO?
Plus Telecom Namibia requires/forces the customer to honor that agreement… See more"
In other words our housese should turn into a Fritz box museum or how? Who've hurt you Telecom Namibia ?
How will you find out?
Telecom Namibia how does my router become your property if I paid for it the day internet was installed I paid for the router in full plus connection fees so I dnt get your story unless if you gave free routers to some customers who might have not paid fr for it
"If the router is your property, then do not charge clients for it. #klaar"
"Telecom Namibia Please the Nyaope your smoking, stop while the is still time!!"
Will you refund what I paid for it upon handing in the device?
The comments was nice guys….y’all have covered it properly
Is this device not bought ano..me no understand ? Perhaps we cn get the right to sell but with your office approval to change ownership or renewal of contact.
Make sure you damage beyond repair them before you hand them back.
Sorry but we have paid for our router and I have the right to do whatever I want to do should I discontinued with ur service.
Sincere and very frank advice!
The question is are this things still yours I mean we bought them mos
Mine stopped working when I moved from that other dangerous place because the network is swak. It will be in the trash bin soon.
"We we pay for this device, we don't get them for free. So we can dispose in anyway we want."
I gave mine to a strong witchdoctor. You can go get it from him yourselves.
Are you going refund us or what will happen? I can't loose it for free just like that.
Are you going to buy it back?
Too late...
Than you refund our money
Ugh
"But we pay for them which means that, they are our own properties unless you will pay back our money"
Telecom Namibia I have paid for my Fritzbox. How is it that it is now owned by Telecom Namibia when I have paid for it? Please explain.
What I'd I pay cash for it? Is it still yours or mine?
Is there a refund involved?

If we take it back to Telecom will you reimburse us for it then?
As long as you focus on catching the thieves you will not stop this.
Insurance running into the ground. Lol
We have no adequate businesses and job opportunities in Namibia. Laws enacted over a greed conscience have suppressed us mercilessly.
Your network is not fine today Ongwediva-Onamutai

"We are used to this threat, if you don't know how to suspend we can suspend them ourselves."
"The same energy you put in to announce the suspensions of accounts, pls transfer that energy to service delivery as well. Collecting subscriptions only without providing the promised service is actually equal to potential fraud. Telecom Namibia"
You've been experiencing connection issues all month now you want to suspend people accounts....DAYLIGHT ROBBERY
I think we should collectively come together and open a case against telecom namibia for poor service delivery imagine you are paying tens and tens of thousands for their internet services which you use to run critical services like health care etc but… See more

You only know how to suspend accounts on time while your wifi services is so slow. Please improve your services
"Waalye, ninga shitoningi maan, jou condense milk"
That is great. We did not pay deliberately
You are threatening to cut a service that you hardly provide. Doesn't Make sense.
Why is telecom Namibia not in the System of Dstv and other service providers where if you don't have money no extra charge but now it's like a cash loan you don't pay it doubles what is that..
Maybe you must email our bills as you have done for the last 3 years. We are still waiting
This bull shot but can’t give our free data and Wi-Fi
There is no value for money and efficient service as you claim.
"Would help if you send out your invoices and we don’t have to ask numerous times

Fix your network first man especially in oshakati we can't be paying datas for the whole month and you always have internet issues
Suspend your accounts we don’t care! We are covered by your competitor MTC!

"Money lovers
service is very poorly"
"Telecom Namibia hope you’re reading the comments almost everyone is worried about your service, your network is so poor."
"This is what you are good at but when our service is down do we suspend you! You should be ashamed of yourselves. Greedy, incompetent and selfish corporate"
"To provide value for money? You were supposed to be the last entity to say that statement. Your turtle internet is very far from value for money and efficient services, swallow your pride and ask MTC where they get high-speed internet."
"Telecom is a big company but why having poor network ano, they are so ignorant?"
Still waiting for our free datas
Telecom Namibia stop behaving like Swapo
"Call center agent: ""what do we do when they start asking about the free data again?"""
"How many times you guys have to apology? Your service is worrisome, sacks and questionable at same times."
Is telecom being operated by interns??
Last time you promised us free datas...let's know that you changed your mind...
Just provide us with service - not empty promises of free data
If empty promises was a person... you're just like some people's boyfriend
It's a lie.

Telecom Namibia do you want us to take a peaceful demonstration to demand our free data?
"But I am still unhappy. Telecom Namibia please improve your network, shaashi it might not end well"

Best is now to invest in infrastructure including a better more realisable backup like google equinox then the unreliable one you have going to SA. As an ISP it’s of the utmost that a secondary line equivalent is gotten by telecom.
So telecom doesn’t plan to give the Wi-Fi users prepaid unlimited users any free data at all they claim that it’s only the mobile

"Poor service, I better spent more on MTC rather than spent less on poor quality products of Telecom Namibia"
Uselessness is becoming their logo everywhere
"This tn mobile is a scam, you subscribe to a jiva supreme, after that the network excuse and we are left dry. No remedy to that. Yet you are promoting. Is this witchcraft?"
Why don't you improve your network ?
telecom needs to be sued for constantly taking money for a service it has no capacity to provide.
I don't understand this $30 bucks just for 3 days while there are subscriptions for 7 days!?. Someone explain please.
Telecom Namibia fix ur Network it's wasting money buying data's I can't use

"Telecom cannot control if a shark comes and munches on a cable. Internet will be back when repairs are done in due time. For now, go outside and touch some grass."
"Telecom please 3 months your service is just poor, refund our money."

"Stop using old system of cables, move to satellite connection"
"Soek re divers wat kan gaan,of vra Sean naidoo laat hy julle help"
Excuse after another... A week can not go by without internet connection interruptions
When will this be fixed???? It's been weeks!!!!
Telecom Namibia everyday you have a problem
First you said you need money. Now it's fibre break. Now which one should we help?

Paratus se internet werk dan reg? Gebruik hulle nie ook WACS?

"You were suppose to fix all these issues before introducing the sim card to us,this is too much to handle huh"

I don’t understand why this problem keeps on persisting. Please hire competent people.

TN ur requirements are too much at least deal away with declaration and proof of residence.
"Telecom Namibia I submitted mine around February 2023. What is the problem here , you are encouraging people to register but I'm being bypassed, like what is the problem. .I'm taking this really personal..this ain't funny.."
Van Wyke
I bought a card and tried to get internet settings call 11000 never answer left msg still non the wiser bought jiva and could not even use it. So is it just me or is this poor service cause I no longer have an interest in using this sim if I cannot use internet
"Og, please Telecom Namibia not all of us we can afford to get the proof of residence please"
"What's this proof of residence for when it's simply registering a sim card? And for someone who lives in a rural village, what proof of residence must he/she bring?"
"Really Telecom needs to advance its network, it's very slow or it will be out of service for 2 days ne man."
If am to buy Sim card at your shop what else to do I need to take a long?

But improve your network is to slow
Why is it always Telecom cables being stolen? Maybe you should ask Paratus and MTC how they protect their properties and copy from them. We are tired of this song of yours. Improve the security of your cables if that’s what it means
That is their default excuse. It is annoying to clients whose work depends on your services.
"You are on your best.... No service. Why, just why do you inform us??.we expect it"
Last night from 12 midnight your fiber Wi-Fi went until 2 midnight in Khomasdal 16 .The way we pay full amount you should learn to compensate
"Telecom with ur excuses every month, improve ur services, we gambling in ur company... after paying no network connection...
Pooooorrrr seeeerrrvesss improve vakuetu"
"Your internet is bad, I lost my job because of you, they hate it"
How long will this take
Did they also steal the cables in Okuryangava since Saturday?
Grootfontein same here please Telecom

"When will there be measures put in place to avoid cable theft,since its the ""only"" reason why there is always service interuptions or poor network coverage?It is really bad especially in rhb,you will have to do something about the theft"
I can supply you with lockable manhole covers. How many do you need.
Your network delays us
Are you now going to replace our day for not using data or what now?
Poor service ever
The side of Otjomiuse your network's always slow or at times unavailable at all
It's also not working in Gobabis
These maggots need a tough competitor
"What's your solution to poor network in Swakopmund fellow residents. I hardly get past 400kb/s browsing speed. I spend the whole day TRYING to download a 160mb file, day and night. There is just no peak or off-peak moments."

even in swakop it's is too slow
What about Grootfontein? We have no wifi today??
"Why not from 22:00,, from 00:00 we are sleeping already,, so we can wake up early and get ready for work again"
Lemme know if you upgrade the network so I can subscribe for JIVA goed.
"Telecom Namibia the way you treat us with your nertwork is very boring ,your 200minutes are not enough,time for expiring atleast 00.00 not anytime nooo thts not it
In Walvis bay network is killing us...1000 SMS where suppose to be Minutes"
I think you should review the network first. I never pass 400kb/s speed when surfing so I guess you know how slow the downloads are at that speed. Your packages are attractive but your network makes it difficult to support you.
Expire date must be extended to 00:00 please TN and the 200 minutes is too less make it 500
"Thank you , only if the network coverage can also be improved, like Omuthiya no 4G Telecom Namibia"

The way your network is very poor in walvis keep on wondering if you are serious with service delivery and respecting your customer's or you just completely don't care
I really hate that we have to rely on your product.
You have no customer relationships. Your call centre does not pick up. I suspect you have a hot chocolate fountain that makes your complete call centre want to go to the toilet at once. Know one can answer. Stop the fountain
Sluggish network too bad.we are migrating to mtc.
Telecom Namibia Hopefully this will solve the nonsense of having to put one's phone on flight mode for 5 minutes so that the correct balance reflects after a recharge!
"Uncle your network is disappointing us here in Walvis bay please, I don't know why?"

Your fibre network keeps going on and off.. SO DEFINTELY NOT FIXED... SWAKOPMUND
Services have not been restored.
"Ya'll should have just left it as it was..now its worse..network cuts off here n there during the day n totally after 12am ..what the he'll mahn,can't even use WhatsApp..what a useless network with such great data rates and packages but USELESS..its a shame"
Are you sure it’s restored?
"Where did you restore?
Still no changes where I am."
Swakopmund still very bad. On and off the whole day. Have phoned technicians and reset the lines. Are you still having problems? Or what is going on? Please we need to work.
"Do you guys have like 1 for each day of the week, without dates, so it comes in handy regularly? #AskingForAFriend"
"This happens almost every week, please try to improve, else you must reduce the monthy payment."
We still don't have service in Dorado Park in Windhoek
It's not restored in CBD Windhoek... Speedlink Prepaid Service . Don't lie
Definitely not restored on fibre. Services are going on and off the whole time
UR INTERNET IS NONSENSE MAN.MXM PAYING WIFI FOR NOTHING
In Kuisebmond WalvisBay it's very slow. Pls improve your service that we are paying for with our hard earned money
Telecom Namibia please improve your internet service in Kuisebmund Walvis Bay very slow.
Keep on improving your internet is something else..
How about adding a day or two to the people who bought your “unlimited 30 days” and had no internet for a few days ? Does not seem fair to not compensate these customers
I can't believe that the service of Telecom Namibia has not improved one bit in all these year's! It is very frustrating to have to call customer care on 11000 and be kept on hold for 5 to 10 minutes only to be cut of once an agent answers. Pathetic service.
So that is the reason you didn't want to pick up your calls since Wednesday?
"Your service ist still not working normally in Swakopmund!
After 14h00 it’s almost dead.
Before that it’s on off the whole time.… See more"

The problem has not been resolved! It still persists in the Rocky Crest - Khomasdal area.
Telecom Namibia how do I become a promoter of your company?
"Since 13:00 my internet connection is gone it’s saying DSL connection interrupted, what can I do guys?"
Ondangwa no change at all
If you guys you don't want us to use your network tells Us so we can not waste time and mostly our money thanks you
Hi im still struggling with slow Internet. Called 11000 apparently no issues reported for khomasdal. The number 11444 not answering. Getting frustrated now
Ain’t no way coz I bought the unlimited data pack for 7 days but I’m not enjoying any of it because I can’t stream movies or even game stream . So if I buy for 1k+ the data will be bad too ? Swakopmund

"Fluctuating internet is permanent in osona village, when are you to solve that problem"
Late update
"So your so called technicians only noticed this now, maybe your employees are working for free neh."
"TN mobile check the expired date and time e.g jiva supreme, change the time to 00:00. Your time is expired anytime."
"Pls expand your network coverage country wide I want migrate from MTC to TN, we suffering at hand of MTC"
In Walvisbay too
You need to expand your network the whole north especially wamboland ( Ompundja Constituency)
"It's Normal for Telecom, we not surprised"
unreliable is the only word that describes TN
A relationship with TN Mobile is an abusive relationship

No wonder the network trips now and then Sometimes we are jus paying for services not used
