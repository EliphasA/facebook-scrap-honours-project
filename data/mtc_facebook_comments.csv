"MTC Namibia, you could have just added some minutes for this mega data promo. Just to do more and good for customers for once."
Us we are fine with TN mobile 100nad for 30GB for 14days
"Oh MTC must change no no even me I bought superAweh just one day, I only had 1 GB"
We thank you but the duration allocated to data is somehow not ok. Anyway those that are enjoying this let them enjoy.
"MTC will never, and i mean never lower it’s prices to compete with TN mobile because they cover most rural places and TN is only mostly in urban areas."
"Love this
Its really worth the money."
But MTC datas dont last. 3GB finishes in two hours.
"Thank you MTC , please make it permanent"
MTC Namibiaa how many minutes does that 59 bundles have?
"Hi there Emma M February Please note that MegaData has no minutes but data only.
-AE"
I just bought 10gb data just to use it for 7 days.
Julle check vir ons Dom ne...
7 days are very few
MTC when is black Friday en what smartphone on special
TN The best
Ano if it is my data that I bought why should it have an expiry date.. Allow customers to buy their data and use it for as long until it's depleted
MTC why are you being a small brother to TN mobile ... Give more then TN the duration of the the 30gb supposed to be 31 days ....
I don't know what happens to MTC research development department.
TN is still better. 50GB for 220nad for 30 days plus minutes
Can you do Aweh Aweh minutes also please just for us who does not have smart phones. What i can see here is not for everyone
The bad part is that the data is for 7 days
I'm good with TN mobile as for mtc she's the sister of FNB those 2 will make u ngwangwan
It's the same price it was last month

I will not pay 300 for 60GB data while having wifi at home and at work for 14 days. When I get to 10GB I am loosing 20GB. Why can we just use it till its finished?
Why is MTC pretending like megadata for 10gig isn't usually 59? It has always been 59.
"An error occurred with the connection, please try again later."
Please fix your network. Is getting out of hands
"Please extend your 7 days offer to 14 days, all awehs asemblif.... 7 days are very few for 53dlr"
With TN I got 50Gg for 150 for 30days... to hell with MTC
"Your Datas are very fast please MTC Namibia ,get example to telecom please thank you"
"The validity of the bundle is a joke! How can it only be valid for 7 days when you rightly advertised, ""Black November""?
Why not until the end of November?"
I used 5gb in half a day. Mtc there data we buy don’t last like the super awah data? Why?

Mtc I don't just stay on phone 24hrs I have some other things to take care of....
MTC Namibia What if I recharged and made #SuperAweh plus the 5GB that's added onto it? Won't it affect my initial data?
"5G for a day, uuf"
Aaahhh it's giving Zimbabwe
That promotion terms and conditions are not clear!
Why put expire date on data
Mtc you know how to make jokes neh
24 hours is less make it at least 48 hours.
We don't spend our 24 hours on your data. It's not even healthy for our eyes. Put the 5g on super aweh. It will make sense

"With this package you still have to recharge $10 on a weekly basis while you are on Aweh Ultra or Aweh yo Data, otherwise you won't access Internet banking or make calls. A clear cheat."

MTC Namibia is there no package with at least 10GB up and it’s a monthly subscription?
"Mtc, are you fine?"
The WhatsApp bundles is a scam. Imagine it can deplete quickly without using it much. TN Mobile data for 20 dollars can give you 1G and you can use it for more days both internet surfing and whatsapp than super Aweh
MTC change Yr data's are too fast no man y
"MTC advisors, pls follow comments and suggestions. Your data packages are unreasonable. Do you want God to come and inform you? Take a good example from TN mobile data packages."
MTC being monopoly in business doesn't mean you have to punish your customers. The commotion of internet data and talk minutes depletion within one day is very high now. I am making a move to TN mobile for a better service.

mtc is very stingy with data? True facts
"Foko mani...you re getting irritating..,you eating our data nai,and you network is getting pooorly from 19pm,draining our batteries...."
TN mobile....we are fine with you.
"Mtc okwafa oswapo, Kuna eshi toningipo Kutya ino panda"
250 for 1GB in 30 days that's robbery
TN it's batter then...MTC
Pathetic
Mtc please make 200 we are ur client
1gb with Mtc for 30days se moer
But I downloaded it recently but not working
"I downloaded the app
I registered my sim
But app keeps telling me to register my sim… See more"
"Thank you mtc, 30 days Aweh
I have been look forward to this"
How do I know how many GB I get for 30 days
More information please how much cost this packages?
"Frans Vatilifa Hi there, kindly click the link here:https://bit.ly/MoAweh"
Good thing I left my contract. Aweh Aweh...
Can you share the recharge codes so we start already
"Oswin Fischer Haludilu Hi there, you can SMS your desired package to 13400"
Can't wait to try the 30 day Aweh
"Slow Clapping for 30 Days Aweh
......."
So the one for 30 days is unlimited minutes and data or?
How can Super Aweh data last for 1 day?
MTC should introduce the packages without limits those only get finished according to the buyers usage.
"I don't know if MTC marketing manager doesn't know math or they think we are dom, this Aweh is more expensive than buying x4 supper in a Month, and that Aweh for a month data are not guaranteed that they will reach for another month."
Grateful mtc
I'm not satisfied yet... TN mobile is still better than this
Tn is the best 50 gb for the whole month for only 230
MTC Namibia does Aweh Ultra include night surfer or that's still only for Superaweh?
"The Aweh Ultra, does it include free data night surfing as well"
Contract lines we have no benefits please.
15Gb nearly not enough to last a month let alone 2weeks.... Come on MTC please do better
"TN Mobile is the best, 10GB for 7 days.
$52 only. And thier chopping speed is slower compared to MTC."
Those data are nothing at MTC. They'll be finished up in one day.
"TN mobile is better. You can even introduce Extreme Aweh, but you data will not be comparable to that of TN mobile. Julle vat vir ons vir hol"
The data are not enough for 30 days and it's expensive. I'm not impressed at all.
"Introducing the so called new products is worse then those we are having already, we're surfing internet for crying out loud.."
Are they available in vending machines/airtime city?
What is Aweh yo voice?
Day light robbery
"This is nonsense, what can someone do with 18GB monthly? That’s very less yet the money is too much. Stop robbing people of their hard earned money with useless package"
"MTC Namibia,are the old Packages still available?"
"Aweh yo Voice (small) …
Definitely for us that don’t like making phone calls. Kudos MTC Namibia"
What are the sms for like serious we only want datas and minutes not sms we're not school kids to be chatting all day. We need more datas than everything.
"Never for ever man
I'm married to TN"
Aweh Yo Ndjara
Improve your network please
"7 day super aweh is still cheaper, and more data, voice and SMS. So the new products hardly make sense."
Why a lot of smses? I don't have time to sms.
Aweh ultra is expensive TN mobile is better you get 10 gb for N$50 mtc' packages are way too expensive
"All we need from Awehs are Datas and Minutes, we don't need Smses. Minimum Datas for any Aweh should atleast be 3Gb and Maximum 50Gb or more. Give the people what they need please."
How to register awehyodata?
That's a good move. Now we gonna go back to mtc again mala only if they slow
MTC you really think we are a joke to you ne!!
It's funny thts day robbery I can't buy that better to switch to tn
MTC your package are expensive 18GB per month for 250! sorry...
"Tim Ekandjo, how are you goingbto manage oil at namcor and air time at Mtc?"

I solute TN
"Improve your network please MTC, we don't use our data as suppose to, this so stressful. And when Aweh Expires, it goes with our datas, this is not fair.... You're robbing us"
Is always postpaid what about prepaid?
Ah we don't need this. We want prepaid
Lag..
How about prepaid?
Mtc u r becoming relaxed. Maybe it's the lack of competition. Tn am with u!

Dee New Chapter free money is valid for three days.
"I recharge en I didn't get anything

Pls contact us on 13000 so we resolve it.
"3 days ?
, it's like I won a bucket of burgers
and you want me to finish them as soon as I won them . What if I am not in the mood of calling anybody? I went for camping"
That's 3 for 50
How is it free money if I buy it with 50 bux?
But N$330 is only equivalent to 330MB?
"MTC fix your internet speed, you are robbing us, Internet speed in the Capital but it's like one is a forest village"
"I recharged but you can't even use this free money, useless service"
U be forced to finish tht 330nads in 3days making unnecessary calls in th name of finishing th mny. Pls recharge urs nd dnt bother us wth free calls
"What about those owed Taamba, are you guys not going to pay
it back for them later giving free money ."
"We have superAweh already MTC Namibia just give us free money, or double our data,sho kubotya kashipo,never forever"
"That was supposed to be free money to last until you deplete it, that is daylight robbery"

"Dear MTC, how about you ewallet me the N$330? I'v no one to call, however I've got a list of groceries I need to buy."
"This is one of the worst efforts Ive seen. N$330 free money which you cannot turn into data, not use to buy Any of the aweh packages, you can use it for sms, calling or just go on the internet purposes. The best part is its only valid for 3 days
. What a joke…."
"Only if we can use that free N$330 to register aweh. But now it’s useless that we can’t. We are about the gigabytes please, not calls."
We've recharged but didn't get anything
"Can you use your free money to fix your network and data...Your data is always not working. We are missing out on important matters tog. Ano what s
Is wrong?"
Can I transfer those money
"I only got 272, can I transfer it to someone?"
"Mtc otonyokoma oshiwana mahn o superaweh datas ainingi ike efiku opuwo oyapwako just a single day whn you come up with this doubling aweh, you better create up another aweh with more than 5GB"
Valid time????
"Why only 3 days , ?"
MTC WHY IS YOUR CONNECTION SERVICE IN GOREANGAB EXTENSION (S) SO POORER . PLEASE UPGRADE!!!!!!
"MTC Namibia only 3 days
I’m glad I’m not buying it mxiim"
MTC free money will be valid till when?
MTC Namibia I reach 65 super aweh but I didn't received the free money
You really think this tricks of yours are nice? When you get free money you can’t even share it with people plus you can’t use it for Aweh. Plus why can’t we use it for international calls if some of our loved ones are abroad
Poverty and you guys you need competition with other company in order to stop this nonses you are doing
Free money.or free airtime. Just explain mtc... let it last till end of month aiye
Mtc you're a big scam in Namibia. Your datas are fast
"The reason why unemployment youth are protesting, not everyone can afford $50 for airtime, so us the poors we don't deserve free money from the 5$ or 10 we will recharge"
I have recharged 65nad but I didn’t get any free money. #MTC MTC Namibia
This supposed to start yesterday not today
"MTC Namibia you are a joke, how on earth I waste my 50 nads just for three days? Come up with a better offer than this one."

"Mtc please fix Erongo region problem, we need to work and need the internet."
"I think MTC lack competent technicians , 24 days to restore full speed networks and still not resolved, It’s now the 2nd time in 30 days this is happening"
My super aweh data lasted for less than 20 minutes
Mtc when are you going to announce the winner of jackpot trivia?
Oho oj
Your network sucks MTC Namibia
"Stop sending random, irrelevant SMSses and sort out your network instead."
"MTC, this can’t be happening. You posted this 12 hours ago and your is not yet done. Mxiuum"
MTC please notify us the same way you remind us to pay back taamba.
"Your technicians are incompetent, 48 hours of downtime is not acceptable by any standards."
You are busy plugging your 5G radiation things. We know wat you are doing
"MTC Namibia's service is utterly pathetic, initial notice dates 19/02 @ 11:00 and 36+ hours thereafter no update, but they want to be paid promptly and they won't ever compensate us by virtue of x amount discount on next month's billing, thus ripping us off."
I am still unable to call since last night and I’m in Tsumeb MTC Namibia WHATS GOING ON??????
Mtc we as your loyal clients are aging and please try to change your blue theme when notifying us ... we barely read those words into a blue background theme.
But who won the Jackpot Trivia 250 000. And monthly 120 000. No Really mtc.

Still no update of mtc...nee wat this country needs competition...tn mobile gives good data but terrible network mtc gives less data but good network but always breakdown..
Still no update
Internet still down. Any ETA on when the issue will be resolved?
"The most pathetic network provider I've ever known. Jissis. More then 10 days they deduct money from my bank, until now I didn't received any airtime. That means they steal from me under false pretenses. Get your selve ready, I will sue you for all the… See more"
What is going on with mtc contact centre number it plays music then just goes silent no voice to be heard nothing while still being connected
MTC your internet is still down countrywide. What is going on? At least update us. This is really frustrating
"Please go and learn from your admin department, they are always ON-POINT when you can steal our money for not delivering a service"
Dont expect feedback. Just like the SOE in our country there is no service at MTC Namibia
And resolved for 1 hour now back to unresolved
I didnt realise our Erongo whatsup group was offline .
MTc What time will you restore the networks please?Your network is still down ogh
"You are becoming worse than Telecom, but Telecom users are having less and less problems."
Please advise - has this been resolved already? Can you give an ETA?
"Its happening often this last while with us not being able to make calls or use the internet and we still have to pay...
Mtc #misstheconnection"
"Aie you want to plead with us now, when you dont listen to us when we complain of you chopping our data"
It's since that network upgrade you had from the 15th things got worse sowaar!!
Is normal at mtc.. we are not surprised..... endjoy the monopoly while u can.
"Lol, it's been like this for the WHOLE day! Now you want to come here with public announcements. Mxm"
"Mtc you need a competitor cse you relaxing too much now, erongo it have been with bad network since that day wen network was bad country wide"
"Still slow slow or NO internet!! More than 24H ,that’s unacceptable in the year 2023!! MTC = TELECOM

"But you didn't restore my bae yet..
We didn't meet tonight"
Network and internet still poor
"We suffered almost 10 hours without network
Please give us free network for 10 hours to forgive each other. The coast is full of Vistors from all the regions and Those with accommodation facilities suffered as a result of this."
One day I went to the mountain to kill myself bt all of a sudden the snake came out of no where and chased me..
This issue started at 16h00 and your Spectra Home is very slow in Windhoek. I had to restart my WiFi Router and phone 10 times thinking it was my devices.
"Even in WhK
I restart my phone many times"
We needed this interruption on the 14th

It's becoming a norm
Thought my phone it's the one experienceing network problem I have been restarting my phone the whole day... Please mtc improve your service we can't be waiting our money like this
"I am experiencing it in Namibia also, My data is depleted already"
"This mean power failure at the cost affect internet services at the northern part of the country , mtc is no more making the connection is making disconnection shila"
"Let's read the notice well it says ""due to power failures at the coast affecting internet services""this means it's affecting all or part of Namibia ."
I was thinking the system off unregistered SIM card to be out of air started. Today and with my number
The internet network is also not fine at the north.
And our Aweh will expire on the same day while we spent hours without network/internet. Can't MTC consider this as their own failure and add a day to Aweh expiry period? #MTCNamibia
I almost to open my phone en start fixing it thanks for the update
In the process our data is just finishing
Late update …I was about to restart my phone for the 29th time..
"Not only the internet, I am in walvis bay but my phone is just saying emergency service only. I thought my phone is dead, I ordered the new one now I am just waiting for the deriverly guy shame"
"Not only internet, tell it all as it is. MTC Namibia"
But you are eating data's ostory yoye and you don't even give. Us one day internet for free ungrateful
I haven't been able to make phone calls since last week. I am loosing out on so many things... Your network is very disappointing
"I can't hardly work with all the network issues

Mtc you are scammers pls refund my credit that you took with your technical problems excuses pls
Useless service provider you are
Not just the internet services. Can not get hold of anyone at the coast try calling not going through
Why is data depleting so fast of late. May you check your systems please
"Why taking our data ? No network and my data is depleted, day time robbery"
Your network is nonsense countrywide. Mbela ota munyengwa paife. Improve or get out of business.
We experience a lot of lost data will you ease give it back. Sorry for the inconvenience
"No no MTC you disappointed us,at list say sorry with free data"
For how long? Is Okahandja now part of coastal area?struggling with your network for two weeks now.
"Mtc, ur internet problem, is affecting the country or why at northern Namibia we don't have internet too? Fix ur things mani, you're failling the country!!"
Will screenshot this and use it on Pay days when people demand money from me.
"MTC you re busy robbing us this days , last time we had the same problem, 3 to 4 hrs without using our datas and calls but once your network was restored, you did not compensate us for those hrs. I know even now you will not do something for us , serio… See more"

Where did my data went...
Mtc please give me my data back
So this is the reason my super aweh datas depleted in one and half day? I seriously need a refund from MTC Namibia
"Stop with your crap. Its been a month now and every week there is always ""technical difficulties"" are you gonna refund my data i paid for or must i just leave MTC and go to telecom? You guys are not the only mobile supplier you know."
"Just say We are your ENEMIES PLEASE this is not the first time,only Wi-Fi is allowed.what’s going on MTC Namibia
but just resume it tomorrow we are fine for today"
MTC Namibia the internet connection is bad in Windhoek . When will this issue be resolved ?
It's obviously not just the Coast. We've been experiencing the slowest connection all day today in Windhoek
"We asked fr this on the 14th kwali man mtc, not today"
Get your bandwidth right in 061. 4G is laughable. Skip 5G until you can get that right.
"I played tht game everyday I used to check my progress I was at 93% and I used to get 1 question wrong if it's alot after two days playing I was at 83% I remained there until now and I djdnt win anything nt even airtime

MTC Namibia I'm still unable to make calls since Friday
from 8 february to february 2023
I'm guessing it's the same guys who called me claiming to be from MTC saying I won N$5000 in a draw and asking if I wanted it as mobile credit or cash. Obviously most people will say cash and will resume to give their banking info.
And why is their only one share people share the things so you don't go and say I didn't know

"Do people with contracts also have to do this, or not. When I renewed my contract in Sept last year, the man who helped me said no . Now another employee of MTC says I have to. What is the right answer to this. You have my ID no, which should be enough."
Which law give MtC the right to collect biometric data?
"My question is,do I still need to register my Sim card if I bought it in MTC with my ID..or if I renew it..I need this answer please.."
"Nandjenda Kadhuuluma Good day, yes you still need to register your card"
I will rather buy telecom card it's high time for telecom to work on their network coverage to take over customers of mtc doing what with my biometric data?
What must i bring along to register my sim card?
I lost my phone and renewed my sim card with my ID and the declaration from the police. Do i still need to register my sim
"Jo-an Lukas Good day, yes you still need to"
For as long as it is on an opt-in basis because I personally don't want to give my biometrics data to MTC.
I wonder if security is up to par. If other huge entities data can be breached so can MTC's. I guess if I'm being forced I have no other choice but to move to another provider. My personal number as well as that of our entire organization.
"MTC Namibia can you please send a team for registration to Karasburg, we can’t drive 200km to Keetmanshoop just to go register our SIM cards."
Would like to know what will happen if youre system gets compromised and all of Namibia's personal data is sold on the dark web. Can legal action be taken against MTC or does fine print disclosure wave all legal action.
Can MTC at least make road show for smaller towns like (Otavi)and post those updates on your wall so we knows when exactly you will be around in a certain town
So are we going to register online ???

By law you don’t need to provide your biometrics to register a SIM card in Namibia. You can go read this up on Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) website. MTC are forcing you to use their personal VERIFI service when registering.
Why do you want to collect biometric data which is not legal
Guys if you only registering your SIM card you don’t need to give biometric information. It’s just if you register for VERIFI. Don’t let MTC Namibia trick you into registering for VERIFI if you don’t want it.

Am sure those who didn't register their sim card experience that. Coz I didn't notice anything.

even went to mtc and was told systems were off.. aiyaya"

you guy's supposed to make a notice
or something like informing us ,now some of us otweethwa go Explain clearly to our girlfriend. Some of the ladies were thinking about we rejected their numbers"

"Not that you read this at all. Sort out your packages. 3gb in 8 days isn't enough. Yes it's 8
not 7. And offer bigger packages on OYeah....so I can buy 10GB AT LEAST !!!!"
"I even owe superAweh from taamba ,and its expiring today.please mtc think twice ..."
I want my airtime back! It's unfair
"Why ALL CLEAR now? We heard, why shouting na"
Please Mtc let this happen again on Valentines day. Affect them severely and break their hearts
"Mtc even though you are here apologizing to your number clients, do you know the great damages you infringe on us today , some of us we even dumped
atleast a kasuperaweh will do to your loyal customers just to console us"
"We don't want that dry apology, atleast do something"
Ok thank you next assignment should be on 14 of Feb..you gerrit
MTC we recharge our aweh but we cannot make any call until today will you credit our days which we cannot use our aweh
"Thank you, please repeat this in 14th Feb.
Regards,
Mens Conference Management"
Did this started again???
You were busy selling us mos…
MTC stop drinking on Sundays while knowing very well that Monday is a serious working day.
The arrogance in the caption..
"MTC Namibia I missed a very important call, you failed me today."
"You took so long, we had some payments supposed to be done today,our studies and all other important things and the due time was 14h00.."
"The stress you brought today sorry, no wonder what will happen on the due date of SIM card registration"
Can this please be repeated on 14 Feb?
We are still not able to recharge and your lines are busy
"MTC your network is still work, Especially when we are inside the building, here in Goreangab and other suburbs. Internet does not work at all. Only when you are outside."
I wish MTC can do this monthly or even weekly
Imasheendulula we omwetweethitha.
You must extend our Aweh which is expiring today coz we didn’t use our data’s really #MTC
MTC fix the network totu efifa. Some of us are not using kanyamata. Our people can leave easily
"Fix the Network in the north please...our work requires internet connection, and our work places doesn't have wifi....deep in ombuga"
So when lawyers exit companies they make sure there are issues and this is why there has been network interruptions? The power and the glory.
Oo
Feb Kakogo
"Can you please fix your network and stop sending me that rubbish from 101 i do not play jackpots
.laksaam"
"We want the network mani,, Nxoooo"
Solve the network problem man
Please sort the network issue
Is the network back in Swakopmund
Rather put more info in your adds...like a possible estimated time that it would be back on.
Wena restore the network wena Man about the vacancy we will talk later
Attend to the network issues first please
"Extend our Aweh's then, Today must not count..."
I thought it was because of my unregistered simcard...lol
"I was hearing stories. First, unregistered Sims and second those who owe Tamba"
Been switching my poor phone on and off hoping to see a difference hewa maan
"I almost hit this phone against the wall, thanks for saving it"
"The apology must come in a form of money
. It is 2023 we don't accept those dry apology anymore."
"Switching fone on and off, going thru settings ,yoh. Thanks for the notification"
BY WHAT TIME CAN THE ISSUE BE RESOLVED !!!!!! PLEASE URGENT GET BACK TO US !!!!!
Thank you for the information
I thought it was only my phone
Today MTC has added to the failure of unemployment in Namibia because people missed interviews today as they could not be reached.
"And I was bathing so I go register my card
Ok we are waiting"
"Just wait for it, MTC got tricks when they restore the system all our airtime will be gone in seconds they won't even mind wether you are on AWEH or not kapooot airtime gone!
AIRTIME ROT"
"This is the service I get after registering my card, oh waaw"
This Was supposed to be tomorrow MTC.
Us that registered for SuperAweh will we get an extra day since we cannot call or use Data?
We will cal amushelelo nw if u don fix it
I was bathing to go register my SIM card today because of thise
"How long will this problem take to be corrected?
A person needs to work"
And it's how our data is been finished
I lost alot. Improve your backup system
And I thought I was blocked for not registering my SIM card...
People you should be worried about data theft they took your biometric data when you where registering your SIM card those are sensitive information. What if maybe they are being hacked and your sensitive information is in wrong hands . Things they will never tell you.
I learned to be patient in life. So there was nothing to be worried about
"I didn't have a problem. Mtc...
Does it mean I'm your special customer?"
"Mtc please tell us, what happened to your network in Havana this side of Havana dumping site or Havana primary school? Seriously during the sunrise we are enjoying, but evening time network is failing. We have many activities to do with our data, ei… See more"
Someone went to work drunk or with a hangover and tempered with the system....MTC is a joke sowaar
I removed my sim card 30 times already even texted the guy I bought my phone from that his phone is not catching network . next time tell us on time please .
MTC Namibia how du u fill now as I was dumped due to ur poor network my phone showing that its off from 06h00 till 15h00. Amu piyaganeke e relationship ndaanu man
I reset my phone 3 times now
Not some. All...now I was dumped by my 3 galfriends. Yeseses MTC you will pay.
"We just had a fight with someone that has my money, he kept requesting for the pin 100times, it wasn't going through, let me call him so I say SORRY.."
"Please take your time, We already moved to TN mobile."
"Mtc should consider extending our Super-Aweh subscription, since today's day is ruined..."
"It's too late now Mtc, my relationship is on the line now.. I have to travel 547km to go explain to her why her calls are not coming through... You bring for me (but in oshiwambo)"
And I see people running to MTC outlets for SIM registration thinking you blocked them already
Why did you include me include me in those that are unable to call? You know very well I have a person I use to call every morning. Today you really break my heart.
We get your point make the connection but the thing of you guys are saying we must register our cards wait some of people lost their documents so on if you cut our numbers how now.we must work together i guess! just be patient
How was I suppose to see this should i chose to be a loyal cuatomer of mtc.. I appreciate TN
"At least maan. I almost lost my 1 month relationship
."
How will they see this if they don't have an internet connection? Send the people an SMS.
But were you not supposed to tell us in advance? As I am talking I am single already MTC
"We understand, take your time."
But MTC learn to update your clients on time when there's network interruption
"How can MTC update customer on social media, while they know that network is not working, oh mtc improve"
Stop disturbing the network when you have government officials around. We have got nothing to do to them.
Ano how will it take to solve the problem?? If it about chopping our money it won’t take you a second. Solve your problem please we have important call to make.
"Ahty Nestor You might have shown her so, she can't just act that way for no reason"
"Almost da botchwa ku menhu ava VO CELLPHONE REPAIR
EEMBWA ANGA DAPALULA NEE"
"Emagine how many times I have restarted my phone?
nonsense"
"MTC Namibia introduce effective way regarding Sim registration, i spent the whole day in a queue intending to replace SIM but was forced to go home due to long queued fellow customers."
"That story of deciding how many day should my data of offer expires should end, what more if I want to economize small small till end month."
When will the prepaid customers be included ?
"And now jackpot trivia,"
Can you use the streaming data for social media
When is the draw of trivia?
For how long it cn take?
"MTC, your G4 network is very poor in Windhoek katutula. Please do something about it."
Finally something
This is false advertising only certain postpaid packages qualify for this
"Hi ,how much is it to unblocked a sim card ,because mine is blocked and could't find my starter pack please."
"Please mtc you are telling us to register our simcard while your brunch is only in towns,what about your clients who are staying at the village and in bush,is very hard for them to travel to town for registration,the is no other place for registration … See more"
MTC increase your days from 7days to 30 days like telecom people now they leaving your campany to telecom you can't see that
4G is weak this days
We have network problems we cannot call what's up
Not for contract customers
"Don't top us up, connect us first"
Is this for real
7 days only?
MTC must introduce a way of buying minutes to call without including datas
Can MTC update the public about what is happening.
Please update us till when will the network be off??
What is wrong with your network !
MTC Namibia please update us on the network problem since midnight
This is useless

MTC Namibia wht number do you use to call winners.? Tired of pranks from fools who think they can play with people's emotions.
I did pray too but I got nothing but is long time now
This is awesome. Finally mtc became customer friendly. This year is gonna be terrific.
Make a change at least to transfer data when my aweh finished or minutes it's could be better. You said mtc everything is possible
And what awesome deals do you have for pre paid customers?
Its too much.... Ndati change your superaweh data at 65$ pls 3GB is really little. Its not small but TOOOOO LITTLE
Your customer service is weak. I called in to find out what depleted my Aweh data within seconds and your staff couldn't even assist me. Imagine 3GB gone within minutes. So useless!
Mtc and betting same WhatsApp group.
I don't agree with your data is just running out like a second my credit is running out while am having aweh if you called them just fruitless answer's I lost almost my fourth five dollar credit over the weekend.
This is not for every post paid client. Why only select certain packages? Let us all enjoy the promotion.
Only for those with contract accounts at mtc
It will only last for less than 10 minutes it's finish....
What about minutes?
MTC should stop that story of eats up our/ my remaining credit after I recharge my aweh pls
90 for 7dayz what a hell
What is streaming data?
Greatest...
It's still valid for 7 days
Can you please help me stop this 101 or how can I stop it
"Even if you put that 27GB morning time you'll get a massage say dear customer you have deployed your Whatsapp-FB data out of bundle
I think something is wrong with you MTC you are chopping us like a cancer you are always disappointing me"
Those data a scam 20g for streaming totally waste of time
Mtc is very stingy
Precarious
For the past past 5 years I can depleted my superaweh data even if I hotspot my second phone.What I did was called in and talk to a generous agent who explained to me politely what consume my data as a prepaid customer.I took him only 2 minutes to tell… See more
Useless that can be depleted in 2 seconds
It won't last

Useless
"Mr, MTC, how about the prepaid customers?"
Streaming data entails what exactly?
Anthony Van Der Westhuizen
Bad package why all 20GB just only for Streaming?? This only for those like Tiktok or YouTube mxxm 5.5GB data for 30 days
"make everything affordable to each and everyone,"
It’s because of such reasoning I moved to TN mobile!!! In this day and era MTC Namibia still doesn’t want to learn. This is so disappointing! Telecom Namibia has unlimited data packages! The best decision I’ve made was to join them
Mtc and Swapo same WhatsApp group
I just want to know the plans you have for our elders and people that are deep deep in the villages when it come to sim registration.
I was at MTC to register and was told my contract sim is already connected to my name and I didn’t have to register again.
"Just 1 question, does this registration only apply to tango sim cards, not contracts?"
At least have mobile registration points (more like a roadshow) for places where there are no mobile homes. Imagine travelling 100km to go register a sim..
If i don't have ID how i can do
I jus want to know when are u coming to visit karibib
Registered
You fogot to mention there will be photo taken too..

I won credit twice already within a week.. This game is very enjoyable I like it

I only play when 101 texts only than i remember your existence.Everyday my airtime is on Zero..Its a trap so you take Taamba.."
I play every day but I don't get anything
This Trivia thing is robbing us. You play but never win and your money is deducted every day from your phone.
MTC is just making promises on promises. I'm not interested in any of their Jackpot/Trivia at all.
Why you MTÇ you anauns to play Jackport but nothing to wìn why ìs ìt so you what to take people s money but ìs not Goodwin God eyes the Cray forties pleàce chech this gàme
I can't wait for the due date to unsubscribe from this crap.
"We're in the mid January but so far, only 4 winners were announced. Nah!"
"I don't care if I win or not because the best thing about this whole thing is that it's very educative, I like it"
The questions are educative indeed. They are the reason why I keep playing.even though i haven't won anything so far.
I enjoy playing this game you learn things you don't know and keep your mind alive and busy
I play many time but no win

MTC sheee otwahala omatuwa tulamo omatuwa. itanditakuma vali ihoudu oshiingilisha mbela
Some people use 101 promotion to scam people. They use someone else land line number and that is how they scam people
"How are you all winning and am not ...ive subscribed to VIP, RECHARGE
I play most of mtc trivia games ...i didn't even win 5dola airtime ,,nothing"
"Mtc is ropping us tjiri, only 5dlr airtime that can be won whats that?"

It's a scam just air Time but not those big money
Why are comments turned off?? Is this offer good or bad
"Super Aweh just one hour and data gone , this real pain me.. MTC do something.. That's impossible"
"What about Netflix, Prime video,YouTube and Spotify."
"With MTC postpaid datas, only 2GB that works from the 20 GB, the rest of the datas doesn't work.. Stop scamming people MTC! The Namibian"
"Mtc we want more data please, not just these 3 gigs and 2 gigs"
Mtc change your system please let the 42 000 minutes be the datas and let the 3G datas be the seconds for super aweh.
LoL that nice
Mtc must give us free datas one day
"With MTC postpaid datas, only 2GB that works from the 20 GB, the rest of the datas doesn't work.. Stop scamming people MTC! The Namibian"
Mtc intoduce Lay-bye even 2month
"When startng free data""""""""??"
"MTC I think you should look into ur system how the data get used (depleted) I don't think your system is differentiating between the different data...I had this package mainly streaming from YouTube, Netflix... but the package ended with all other data… See more"
Does the package have happy hour?
Will stick to my tn mobile
Is this also just for seven days?
What happens after dialing *683# and after entering your number?
And pre-paid have which promotion?
Only post paid customers qualify. What about pre paid customers ?
How about prepaid card?
I tried it and there is nothing for N$90 27GB (streaming there)

Always explain in simple English because I was already thinking that we now have aweh for 90dola
Time to dig up my contact number
Too expensive why?
Call me back but no signal
Like serious?
i do not understand the advertisement
The text above does not mention $90 for 26.5gb is for 40days but the add at bottom says so.
"How do i use 26GB in 30 days ? No one can be so insane. Unless you guys make it up to the customer to finish those data when ever she or he wishes. Not limited to 30days or one month. That sucks. Can you also do aweh unlimited please ? That,s crooking. Namibia economise"
How many minutes is this
Tell me more about the leftover credit after purchasing Aweh service that vanishes in thin air while the purchased service is still valid.
This will last for how many days?

Let them come to me..
"Elvis Demager Eichab Snr Share location. Else, let's meet at the nearest Mobile Home. We just want to see something..."
the word “mandatory” reminds me of the coronavirus injection. It was a very annoying word
"Am-plo Myc Desy-pax LOL, so you can imagine your Sim Card being socially distanced from the network grid because you were annoyed by the word 'Mandatory'. Register your Sim Card and we promise not to make you read that word again."
"MTC Namibia,what must I bring along for me to register my Sim,it's true that I should have declaration and paper water,we're are confused here"
Just register all the new Sim card already.. you are always behind
David Iipinge We see what you did there.
"I don't emphasize online registration these plenty time to do so...an one thing MTC must introduce captured of image to the person who is
register that particular sim card if you really want to combat cyber crime."
"I replaced my cards in July but still need to go verify, why didn't they do when I went to replace my simcard? Wasting our time"
"I am advising the MTC to request another extra days,to extend the registration cos a lot a not yet registered,like deep down in our village, I pity them..."
Jeremia Lukas We appreciate that you will spread the message.
"Khorixas don't have MTC home, we went to Otjiwarongo several times but the quee is long every day. Can't we be service with Mobile home, cause it's not logic getting it done in short period"
"Annanias Sanib That is surely what we have started doing, going out into areas with no Mobile Homes, but in the meantime, meet us halfway and visit any of our mobile homes closest to you."
I will register if I get my Aweh MTC owes me for Covid Vaccination their promised me
"Ruben Cheeza Muisoor We might want to look into that so kindly inbox us the full details. However, in the meantime you have to register your Sim Card so that you continue enjoying our products such as Aweh."
"MTC Namibia what about the number we heard registering people's simcards online , which is karma *68966#. Is that really for mtc or just a Scam number from scammer out there?"
"Hi there, SIM registration is done in person at our MobileHomes only. Kindly be aware of such numbers as they are a scam."
Establish more Sim registration centre's if possible ' use mobile points as well to reach out to schools and other work stations which renders services to people on a daily basis...
"Trocado Mubuso That is surely what we have started doing, but in the meantime, meet us halfway and visit any of our mobile homes closest to you."
Use mobile points. People in the rural will be affected much. For now MTC must reach the people.
"Sixtus Mukoya II That is surely what we have started doing, but in the meantime, meet us halfway and visit any of our mobile homes closest to you."
"I am not against SIM card registration, I just have a problem with standing in a queue"
"Better mtc to have police people in their mobile so that we must not travel /visit the police station for feeling in documents, it's a long process and consuming time"
Take your services to the people in rural areas
"K Loo Jessica Lukas That is surely what we have started doing, but in the meantime, meet us halfway and visit any of our mobile homes closest to you."
I think MTC Namibia must start mobile registration In the villages because some people are really far from towns with MTC branches and we don't want our parents to be cut off because of this new implementations. Speaking for my family and everyone that… See more
"Pandu Lonia That is surely what we have started doing, but in the meantime, meet us halfway and visit any of our mobile homes closest to you."

What I can bringing so that my sim card can be registered
MTC namibia where can I register in omuthiya
Ningenisheni Ottilie Your closest MTC Mobile Homes are in Ondangwa or Tsumeb.
Do online registration at least
"Omc Simon We see what you did there, awoke."
Give use any example or numbur where i can register
Antonia Ambambi Sim Card registration is only done in person at any of our Mobile Homes. Any other number circulating under the pretext of Online Sim Registration is NOT the work of MTC Namibia.
"I have a problem with my contract number, I bought data which are not working I can't use WhatsApp to view status or call. Why it so I have a lot of GB in data?"
Seriously Mtc expect my 95year old mother to be brought to mtc office to register her sim Card?
"Those that are sold in other shops, do they register?"
"Mathew Mashuna As from 1 January 2023, you will need to register those before use."
Us legends will register our Sims on 31 December 2023
Mee Cynthia Not a wise idea from a legend. So lets do it before the due date. Legends don't wait until the last minute.
Can we register online as well?
Jennifer Jenny Iipinge Sim Card registration is only done in person at any of our Mobile Homes. Any other number circulating under the pretext of Online Sim Registration is NOT the work of MTC.
Can't I register my sim online
Herman Gideon Sim Card registration is only done in person at any of our Mobile Homes. Any other number circulating under the pretext of Online Sim Registration is NOT the work of MTC.
Hi where in whk can you go for the registration?
"You were suppose to include, what should one bring along when coming to register his/her Sim card."
"Lucas Lu'u Hamukoto Good day. The following documents are required. Police Declaration of Sim ownership, Proof of Residency, and your ID. Registration is free."
Where in Windhoek can one register this week ?
Kemmy Duminga Shiyuka At all our Mobile Homes.
"Jag, online registration please."
Bimbo Sham'kwalu Sim Card registration is only done in person at any of our Mobile Homes. Any other number circulating under the pretext of Online Sim Registration is NOT the work of MTC.
And what happens to those sim cards/numbers which will not be registered??
"After the given registration period, unregistered Sim Cards will be disconnected, as stipulated by the ACT."
"How about old people at the villages with cellphones, what is your plan to reach out to them MTC?"
"Rather register all the SIM cards already then you only assign the owner once purchased. We are suffering too much because of the queues. The process is very slow.Introduce self registration online, shouldn’t be complicated though. Ilo natuye koTN Mobile ano?"
"Mtc shops are always full, us we don't have time to go stand in queues. Set up centers where people can go for registration."
The number *68966# is for what? I was told one can register using that number
"Okongo people where are they registering their SIM cards, we can’t be traveling to Eenhana oshili aaaye, please do something, at least a mobile will do, thank you MTC Namibia"
"Where are this so called Mobile homes? Since this sim card registration story started I didn't see one. And your fixed offices are always full and they close at 15hoo, some people go to work untill 17hoo. MTC you can do better!"
"Immanuel I-mann Jaxson The 'Fixed Offices"" are our Mobile Homes. Kindly make time to visit and register your Sim Card."
"I was in Grove Mall Mtc too register my card,and the lady tell me i must have a police declaration that say its my sim card,so what exactly must i have too register my card,and i never even go back again"
Your mobile team was never in Karibib. Can you kindly explain why?
"MTC Namibia,why is my remaining airtimes after connecting on #SuperAweh keeps on disappearing?"
I registered my Sim card the first time the mobile van came to Karasburg yet im seeing the “ register your sim” logo what’s causing that?
MTC Namibia where are you taking those the finger print and picture you took during the registration ?
Consider mobile teams at schools and regional councilor offices. That story of going to Mtc alone will not work.
"Elandulafano nalyikale lyafa lyopenzela, bring the service to remote areas.."
Why though? Why does mtc want my personal info like that?
"Paa Peter oshe naave bossa
I am last minute type of a guy."
"Mtc we register our cart still scammers are scaming us in the Name of mtc, that we won money as we have register our cart .Be aware of this number 0816647966 is calling people and ask their Bank acc and the behind carts number to transfer money."
"My spectra is useless! I'm on the 25mbps package and it's never higher than 6mbps, but mostly below 2.5mbps."

Prepare for us new year gifts evn airtime
"I have used the 5.5GB data, but now cannot use the streaming data and the social data now that the 5.5gb data is finished."

Does it have free datas from 00:00 to 06:00?
Hilya Tate-Ati
"MTC! Don't you think this is biased, why don't you apply the same benefits to Pre-paid customers?"
I make aweh today and post on my WhatsApp status then boom I don't have data
"I bought more data but I can't use them not working anymore, why wasting peoples money just to project you profit while your customers service rate is poor."
Now what's in for us prepaid cose superaweh ain't last for 3 days
This is daylight robbery
So is this for contract? Not us aweh peopel??
What about prepaid customers?
